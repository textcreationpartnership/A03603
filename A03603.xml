         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN the Words there are two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The conſultation, <hi>[And God ſaid.]</hi>

               </list>
               <p>The conſultation gives us to conſider, partly the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the worke, partly the excellencie, when in all other things it was but a <hi>[Let it be]</hi> but now there is an high Court of Parliament; the three Perſons enter into a conſultation to ſet upon this maſter-piece; better then all other creatures, except Angels, and in ſome caſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then them.

care. Come wee then to the Work. If you aske what's the pinnacle of perfection, from which <hi>Adam</hi> fell (for fall implies ſome prerogative hee had) I anſwer, it was this, That he was made in Gods image, and from this he fell</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</note>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The excellencie of <hi>Adams</hi> condition conſiſts in this, that he was made in the image and likeneſſe of God. Therefore, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle diſputing concerning renovation, enjoynes them to <hi>put on the new man, which is renewed according to the image of him; that created it.</hi> In the Text are two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The worke of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is that we had in <hi>Adam</hi> by creation; and therefore he cals it the new
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14441:6"/>
man. <hi>Adam</hi> having ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed it, Chriſt renewes it againe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that both the worke of ſanctification, and creation, are according to the image of God, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 7.9. God made <hi>Adam</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yea a ſtraight man.</p>
               <p>This is a compariſon taken from a ſtraight line; there can be no crooking in it. So the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> lay levell, and exactly agreeable to the rule of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Put ye on the new man, which is created after God in righteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Looke what is ſpoken of renovation, the ſelfe ſame <hi>Adam</hi> had in creation. Now wee read that the new man is after God, as the print of the wax is after the ſeale;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14441:7"/>
and a man does his work af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a paterne, that is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it: So the ſtampe of Gods image was upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that he was agreeable to his will.</p>
               <p>For the opening of it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve three queſtions:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. What is this Image?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, what in generall.</note>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the generall, it is that ſpirituall ability put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby hee was able to worke as God wrought, after the manner and meaſure of a creature. We doe all things according to our ſcantling: God hath a power infinite, <hi>Adam</hi> had it proportionably. <hi>Adam</hi> was not to equall, but to imitate God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as your father is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Adam</hi> was holy as God, and ordred his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14441:7"/>
as God would. Wee ſay, That the child hath the image of his father, not in bigneſſe, but in likeneſſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in carriage, countenance, or behaviour: Or, as it is with an apprentice, that hath learned the skill of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we ſay, Hee is his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter right; not becauſe he is a man, but becauſe he is a work-man, and imitates him exactly, and carries the print of his skill upon him. So the image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> is not ſo much in regard of the being of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in this, that hee was able to worke as God, hee was partaker of the ſpirituall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God; he was able to know what was needfull, and to will what ever he knew agreeable to Gods will. Had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14441:8"/>
God taken fleſh upon him (as indeed Chriſt tooke fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) he would have ſo behaved himſelfe, and ſo approved of good courſes, (being made after Gods Image) as did Chriſt (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our fleſh upon him) in whom there was no guile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether may any creature be ſaid to be created in the image of God, beſide man?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Only men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels made after Gods image.</note>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No Creatures beſide Men, and Angels. It is true, that in all the frame of the creatures, there is a ſtampe of the holineſſe and power of God left paſſively; there are footſteps of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe left in the creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no creature is able actively to imitate God, to have an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14441:8"/>
holy wil, and to walk anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a mans footſteps in the ſand, and his picture. If his footſteps be in the ſand, we ſay, A man hath been there; but what his ſtature and proportion is, no man can tell: Draw a picture of the ſame man, ſuch parts, and ſuch lims, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers what proportion he is of; The other concludes the man was there, but doth not diſcover his ſtature. If a man ſhould ſee that mans ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſt of his ſtature, hee would then ſay, There is the lively picture of his father: So it is here in the creation of the World; God leaves a foot-ſtep of his attributes, that every man may ſay, Wiſedome, Goodneſſe, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14441:9"/>
power hath beene heere. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>The Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God.</hi> They, as it were, ſpeak it, and offer it to our conſideration. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>That which may bee knowne of God, is in them:</hi> that is, the foot-ſteps of God may bee obſerved in the creatures. But the image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> was like a picture; not a liveleſſe, but a lively picture. As the child that does like his father, doth diſcover him ſomewhat: So did <hi>Adam,</hi> God; he was able to expreſſe the vertues of God, that had created him. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. <hi>As wee have borne the image of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So we ſhall beare the image of the Heavenly.</hi> All the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> had the image of <hi>Adam:</hi> hee was ſtubborne,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14441:9"/>
ſo were they. Now as we have this image from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the ſaints have the image of Chriſt; holy, as he his holy. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe wee have received, grace for grace.</hi> What ever grace is in Chriſt, he puts upon the hearts of his children. There is never a letter on the ſeale, but is on the wax: So every grace that is in Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon his Saints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably.</p>
               <p>The creatures have three things in them:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are the effects of goodneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſhew them forth to the conſideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A wiſe man may ſee the foot-ſteps of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them. The creature
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14441:10"/>
cannot be mercifull, as God is mercifull; the creature doth its nature: the fire burnes, the water moiſtens, but no creature can expreſſe Gods goodneſſe, but <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the difference between the image, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The difference is this: The one diſcovers the frame of the heart inwardly. The ſpirituall power <hi>Adam</hi> had to work, we terme the Image: The diſcovery of this, or the acting accordingly, the Likeneſſe. There is the power of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this power; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Likeneſſe, the former, Image: <hi>Let us make man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our &amp;c.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Let us put a frame into
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14441:10"/>
                  <hi>Adams</hi> heart, and then he ſhall walke anſwerably to it in all his courſes. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.22. it is ſaid, <hi>I have found a man after mine owne heart, which ſhall doe all my will.</hi> This is the deſcription of a man after Gods owne heart; hee does all his will. God hath ſuch an heart as <hi>Davids,</hi> and if he were on earth, would do as he did, except his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be holy as your heavenly Father is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He requireth not onely an inward frame, but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſure thereof. God made <hi>Adam</hi> thus; who as hee had a power in his heart, ſo he expreſſed it in his life, and wrought as God wrought, which no creature elſe could.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:14441:11"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But why did God make <hi>Adam</hi> thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no reaſon on mans part, but it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods will. The Lord is an underſtanding agent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he workes all things for a good end. And the reaſons why God imprinted this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in <hi>Adam,</hi> are two:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why God made man after his image.</note>1. That he might fit him for ſpirituall and heavenly worſhip. God would have one creature neere to him, one of his Privie Councell, that might performe ſpiritual worſhip to him. Now unleſſe God had created <hi>Adam</hi> in his image, he could not have performed ſpirituall worſhip to him, as it was requiſite God ſhould make ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo to doe. <hi>John</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a ſpirit, and muſt bee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14441:11"/>
worſhiped in ſpirit, and in truth.</hi> None can approach to God, but in a ſpirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The trees grow, and the beaſts ſerve man; they do their nature, and grovell on the ground, but reach not to God, becauſe they are not ſpirituall, nor have they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoules. Looke as it is with great Princes, though they imploy ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ordinary affaires, as their under officers, Cookes, and Groomes, &amp;c. yet no man muſt be Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of State, unleſſe he have eminent and excellent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without which he cannot cloſe with his Prince, nor is fitted for him: So, it is true, that the God of heaven hath all things at command, and hee will worke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14441:12"/>
wonders by them: The heavens heare the earth, the earth heares the corne, and the corne heares Iſrael: but none of theſe can wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in prayer or the like, but onely <hi>Adam,</hi> who hath the image of God upon him. <hi>Adam</hi> is Gods councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; <hi>He reveales his ſecrets to the righteous.</hi> An holy man can cloſe with an holy God; they have union one with another. No other creature can come to God, but only man. All creatures ſerve man, that he may ſerve God. The heavens heare the earth, and the earth heares the corne, and the corne heares man, that man may ſerve the Lord. The text ſayeth, God ſeeing that in the frame of heaven and earth, there was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14441:12"/>
not a fit companion for man, did therefore make woman, ſuch another as himſelfe, to be with man: So neither had God one for his turne, when Sun, &amp; Moone, and Stars, and all things elſe were made, therefore Father, Sonne, and holy-Ghoſt conſult to make one that might be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the buſineſſes of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Againe, God purpoſes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate himſelfe and his image to one creature, that he, ſerving God, might be bleſſed of him. God would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate happineſs to a creature, and none could receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had the image of God. Hence (I ſay) they conſult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about it: I will create, ſaith the Father, and do you create, Sonne, and doe you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14441:13"/>
create, Spirit. The work of the Father is diſcovered in creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the work of the Sonne in redemption, the work of the Spirit in ſanctification; all concurre to make him parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of happineſſe. This is the cauſe why no other creature is capable of happineſſe but Men and Angels, becauſe they onely have the image of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe God would have one creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt, that ſhould take notice of his attributes diſcovered in his workes. God would have the glory of his attributes, that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his workes. Hee creates a world; in that world hee expreſſes the workes of wiſedome, power, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When firſt the heavens
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14441:13"/>
were beſpangled with ſtars, the earth repleniſhed with fruits, the ſea with fiſhes, no creature could ſee Gods worke-manſhip, and honour him for it; therefore God makes man in his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, makes him able by wiſedome to conceive his works, and gives him wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to returne him honour from all. It is requiſite, there ſhould bee ſome ſpectators. The goodneſſe of God is in the heavens, they, at it were, ſpeake the providence of God: now wee ſee theſe things, and cannot but admire them. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103. ult. The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaking there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wonders of God in the heavens, marke what he addes, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14441:14"/>
yee all his workes.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, All yee ſonnes of men come hither, ſee, and wonder at the power &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in theſe things, and bleſſe his name for them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Acknowledge the Lord in all thy wayes.</hi> The creature cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God, becauſe it wants the image of God; but man, that hath a ſpirituall ability to know God, cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in all his wayes. Men that have any curious workmanſhip which they would have ſeene, build up a ſtage for the better view of it. Why ſhould they ſet it forth, if there were no man to come, and obſerve it? Juſt ſo God does; he makes the whole frame of the world, and in that expreſſes his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14441:14"/>
power and goodneſſe. To what purpoſe ſhould all theſe bee made, if there were no man to ſee them, and wonder at them? <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.4. When God would raiſe his honour out of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he ſets him upon a ſtage. He might have beene ſlaine amongſt the firſt borne, but hee brings him into the middeſt of the Sea, and there ſlew him. This paſſed not without obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſomuch that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could ſay, Theſe are the Gods that ſlew <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c. What ſhould bookes doe, if there were no ſchollars? The world is the booke of Gods goodneſſe; wherefore ſhould this be, if there were no man to ſtudie it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. The firſt uſe is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,<note place="margin">Dutie to God in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</note> to teach us what
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14441:15"/>
our duty ſhould be to God, ſince his kindneſſe is ſuch to us. <hi>Adam</hi> was a common root, therefore what <hi>Adam</hi> had, thou haſt in him. Hence then take notice of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary duty wee owe unto God. Hath God done more for us then for other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? then let us do more for him. All the world joyned together have not received ſo much as man. As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of man is above all, ſo his care ſhould be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne more to God, beſtow the beſt affections, the utmoſt labour for the promoting of the praiſe of God. What a ſhame is it for a Prince to turne a Peaſant? for <hi>Adam,</hi> the beſt, to become the worſt? If the dog returne to the vomit, and the ſow to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14441:15"/>
wallowing in the myre, if the horſe and mule have no underſtanding, it is their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but <hi>Adam</hi> hath not the image of an irrationall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but the image of God; yea, of that God, that takes it in great indignation, that all ſhould ſerve us, &amp; we will not ſerve him. The Lord lights his candle for man to labour by, he drawes his curtaine for man to reſt by, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures lift us up to God, and ſay, Serve him more then all. Iſaiah 1.2. The Lord makes his moane to the creatures, Shall all creatures obey God, better then man, when man was made better by creation then them? When thou findeſt thy heart ſluggiſh, quicken thy ſelfe thus; Aske the fowles of the ayre, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14441:16"/>
they will tell thee, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedſt all from God; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne all unto him againe. When thou ſeeſt the heavens turne in their compaſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thy ſoule, that thou art ſo dead hearted in duty. The Sunne rejoyces like a Gyant to runne his courſe, becauſe God commands it; the ſea ebbes, and flowes, becauſe God will have it ſo. Nay, the creatures will doe againſt their nature for God. 1. King. 13.5. <hi>Oh Altar, heare the word of the Lord,</hi> and the Altar breaks in peices; the poore ſtones rend in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the commandement of God, and yet after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny threatnings we ſtoup not: let us ſee it, and bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.</p>

The ſecond uſe is,<note place="margin">It is not for one made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods image to dote on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Learne from hence not to be ſervants to thoſe that God hath made ſervants to you. Wee ſhould not bee doting daily upon theſe empty ſhadows, becauſe they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the nature of man. Shall the Lord make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the beſt of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſhall wee abaſe our ſelves below the meaneſt condition of the loweſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Think of this, that wee may conſider whence we are fallen, as God ſpeakes to that Church in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. The drunkard is a ſlave to his cups, the covetous man is a

drudge to the dirt of this world, the ambitious mans being, is the favour of men: Nay more, man is become not onely a ſlave to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but a vaſſall to his owne luſts: Let us be aſhamed of this. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. when divers had diſputed of the excellency of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſayes, Hee all is yours, therefore glory not in your ſervants: The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fals more ſtrongly here, Beſtow not your ſelves on theſe empty things; they are your ſervants, bee not vaſſals to them. Men beare themſelves according to their birth; the King ſcornes to ſtoup to a Peaſant, and a man of Nobility ſcornes to ſtoup to a dung-hill churle. Oh that wee were thus wiſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14441:17"/>
for our ſoules; beare up your ſelves according to your birth, and thinke thus with your ſelves, When profits and pleaſures crave your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, a man ſhould conceive, in an holy ambition, that his heart were too good to truſt to lying vanities: Man is of a better birth; and ſhould anſwer them as Chriſt did the Phariſies comming to tempt him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.21. who, when they asked if it were lawfull to give tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> requireth a penny, &amp; askes them, Whoſe image, &amp; ſuperſcription hath it?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14441:18"/>
Gods; then give to God the things that are Gods. Let vanity be beſtowed upon the world, but thy ſoule hath Gods image; give it him. If a creature be ſtrayed, or ſtollen, though it be disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet when it is found, we returne it againe to the owner: ſo thy Mind, Will and Affections are ſtraying from God, Satan hath ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len them from the familie of the Almighty.

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The image of God was imprinted in the whole man. God ſayes not,<note place="margin">Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the whole ſoule.</note> Let us make a body, or a ſoule, but man in our image. It was not with <hi>Adam</hi> as with children, in regard of their naturall parents; If the child bee but eyed like his father, wee ſay, He hath a brow like his father, and nothing elſe. It was not thus with <hi>Adam;</hi> but as it is with the picture of a man, if it bee drawne to the full propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is a reſemblance in every part, ſo it was with him; there was never a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14441:19"/>
part of his body or ſoule, but there was in them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of thoſe vertues, which are in God infinitely, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. ult. They ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked, and were not aſhamed; the meaning is, The eye of their conſciences ſaw nothing within to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhame them, the eye of their bodies ſaw nothing without that was ſhamefull: but when they had ſinned, not only the eye of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences was open to accuſe them for ſin, but the eye of their bodies aſhamed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that ſtained which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was void of blemiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What reaſons may bee alledged to prove this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſons are three:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Looke where ſin takes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14441:19"/>
place after the nature of man defiled, there was the image of God before; now ſinne reignes in the whole man. Sinne and the image of God are both of a breadth. The privation of a thing can bee no where, but where the thing was; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is no where, but where ſight was, or might have beene; death is no where, but where life was, or might have beene: ſo ſin could be no where, but where the image of God was, or might have beene. Sinne is like leaven, that leaveneth the whole lumpe: there is no whole part in man from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot, therefore the image of God was in the whole man. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Out of the heart come evill thoughts:</hi> There is the throne of ſinne: but <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies.</hi> Thus is the kingdome of ſin deſcribed: for that a man is as it is, <hi>full of all unrighteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 1. The heart is full of malice, and the hand is full of bloud; the heart is adulterous, and the eye wanton; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the members of an Harlot (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks:) for if profaneneſſe be once in the heart, the hand is full of miſchiefe. If then the whole man bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Gods image by ſinne, then the whole man had the image of God before ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The image of God was reſtored to the whole
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14441:20"/>
man by Chriſt. What Chriſt reſtores, that <hi>Adam</hi> had. Chriſt renewes what was before made: now Chriſt reſtores the whole man by ſanctification; which is clear by Scripture. For it is called to this purpoſe the <hi>new man;</hi> not a new eye, or a new hand, but the new man. Thoſe are two pregnant places, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The God of peace ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie you throughout, and I pray that your whole ſpirit and ſoule and body may be blameleſſe unto the comming of Chriſt.</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He that is in Chriſt is a new creature.</hi> He is not a monſter, but a creature. This new creature hath all the parts of a creature: New thoughts, new endevours; the eye ſees chaſtely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tongue talkes holily; all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14441:21"/>
things are new both in body and ſoule. If then the whole man had the image of God repaired, then the whole man had the image of God created.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe the whole nature of man was bound to the Law to obey it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be fitted by the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God to obey it. That all parts are under the law, it is cleare: the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a precept for every part: The eye muſt not luſt, The hand muſt labour, <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteale no more, but work with his hands, Eph.</hi> 4.28. The Law hath a charge likewiſe for the tongue, <hi>Let your words bee gracious, Col.</hi> 3. Thus the Law reaches to the out-ſide; and for the in-ſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is cleare, <hi>Thou ſhalt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14441:21"/>
love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoule, with all thy ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> Unleſſe the whole man had had the image of God, it could not have obeyed the Law: Otherwiſe, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell, or the wicked could obey Gods Law; the ſoule is the ſame in ſubſtance, ſo that if the ſoule as it is a ſoul, could obey the Law, the damned in hell might. It was not <hi>Adams</hi> ſoule, but the image of God, that inabled him to obedience, therefore he muſt have this image, before either his body, or ſoule could obey. A man ſpeakes Latine, not becauſe he is a man, but becauſe he is a ſchollar: a man builds an houſe cunningly, not becauſe he is a man (for then every man might doe it) but by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14441:22"/>
man might doe it, but by vertue of the cunning of a Carpenter: it is not the ſoule in regard of the eſſence of it, it is not the body in regard of the being thereof, that inables a man to keepe the Law. The Devils in hell have an Underſtanding, and Will, but they cannot love God: The eſſence of the ſoule will not doe it, but the frame that God puts into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> The uſe in Generall is this:</p>

of converſation.</hi> It is not enough to have an outſide, this is no argument of true grace; but if ever thou beeſt ſanctified, all is made new. <hi>Hee that is in Chriſt is a new creature.</hi> It is a monſtrous thing to have the eye of a Saint, and the heart of a Devill; to have the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the voyce of <hi>Jacob;</hi> to howle and cry for ſin, and yet to retaine our old corruptions. This is not to bee renewed, but to be patched up, a piece holy, and a piece unholy. Away with theſe appearances; if ever you be ſanctified, the whole man muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. When ever a man comes to meddle with a gracious man, he ſhall find him of another mould. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14441:23"/>
wicked men as it did <hi>NebuchadneZZars</hi> image; the head was gold, but the feet dirt: ſo men have an outward profeſſion, an head of gold, but follow them home, and there you ſhall find their feet dirt. Cozening, and cheating pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes over them. It is with carnall men often, as with <hi>NebuchadneZZar, Dan.</hi> 5. who had the ſhape of a man, but the heart of a beaſt, that is, beaſtly affections: ſo men have the viſage of Chriſtians, but yet ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and proud hearts, that ſcarce <hi>Beelzebub</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath worſe.

               <p>What a ſoule is.</p>
               <p>God imprinted his image in the ſoule of <hi>Adam,</hi> in his Underſtanding, Will, and Affections. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what the ſoule is, The ſoule is an immortall creature, and wee diſcover it by its acts; as in man,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14441:24"/>
by conceiving, chuſing and refuſing a thing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What is this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſpirituall light, whereby the Underſtanding of <hi>Adam</hi> was able to pierce into the nature of things, and perceive them with that perfection as did fit him for the attaining of his end, and performing ſervice to God.</p>
               <p>There are three things in this deſcription:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a ſpirituall light. It is with the Underſtanding as with the ayre; it is capable of darkneſſe in the night,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14441:24"/>
as well as light in the day: So the faculty of <hi>Adams</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was capable of blindeneſſe and ignorance that might delude him, as well as of ſpirituall light that might guide him. A mans eye may have blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it as well as ſight: ſo the underſtanding is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ignorance, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſdome too that might reveale that to us that ſhould be done by us. <hi>Col</hi> 3.10. <hi>Put yee on the new man, that is renewed in knowledge.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. He prayes that the eyes of their underſtanding might be inlightened. The eye cannot ſee unleſſe there bee a facultie of ſeeing put into it; which <hi>Adam</hi> had in his innocencie,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereby the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14441:25"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi> was able to pierce into the natures of things; which piercing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelfe two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Underſtanding of <hi>Adam</hi> was able to cloſe with every truth that was to bee apprehended, if he would diligently beſtow his mind, and thoughts thereupon. If a man will turne away his eye he cannot ſee: ſo if <hi>Adam</hi> would turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way himſelfe, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his thoughts upon an object, he might bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as hee was by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; Not attending was the cauſe of his cozening. Hee had ſuch a ſpirituall light that whatſoever was offered unto him, he, improving his wiſedome, was able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the nature of the truth,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14441:25"/>
and the reaſon thereof: for both theſe are diſtinct. When <hi>Rebeccah</hi> was with child, ſhe ſaith, Why am I thus? She knew that ſhe was with child, but knew not the reaſon of it: but <hi>Adam</hi> could apprehend upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he met withall, both the truth; and the ground of it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. God gave the creatures to <hi>Adam</hi> to name, &amp; as hee named them, ſo their names were. He apprehended every creatures diſpoſition, and accordingly gave them names.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Underſtanding of <hi>Adam</hi> by this ſpirituall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was of that large ſtrength, that he was able to underſtand all occaſions to helpe him in his worke: His reaſon did carry him
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14441:26"/>
clearely &amp; ſpeedily to do his work. This we call practicall wiſedome. It was not enough for himſelfe to ſee the truth, and the reaſon of it, but hee could carry himſelf anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to it. I ſay, this practicall wiſedome made him eaſily doe his worke. As in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentry, a man may ſtand by, and ſay, This muſt be done: but to be nimble in doing the work, muſt be the skill of the Carpenter. <hi>Adam</hi> he could both ſee how to order his buſineſſe, and to doe his worke according to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Hee was able to looke into the creature, and imitate it. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9. the Apoſtle prayeth, that they may bee filled with all <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>wiſedome.</hi> The words are better tranſlated, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14441:26"/>
and wiſedome. To ſee truths, and the reaſons of them, that is wiſedome; to be cunning in practice, that is prudence. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.8. God <hi>hath abounded to us in Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Prudence.</hi> The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to wiſedome is folly, the oppoſite to prudence is blockiſhneſs in a mans whole courſe. Now <hi>Adam,</hi> who had both theſe, Wiſedome and Prudence, was able to take up any trade in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> In what manner had <hi>Adam</hi> this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was in <hi>Adam</hi> in perfection. This you muſt conſider two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Either ſuch as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the attaining of his end: or</p>
               <p n="2">2 Such as concerned the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14441:27"/>
performing of his ſervice that he owed unto God. <hi>Adam</hi> had both theſe very perfect. True<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had not the actuall knowledge of all things. Our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had a knowledge by experience; for the Text ſaith, He learned by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> had not the knowledge of all things, but he had an habituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that hee could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing, that might fit him to obedience. A mans eye doth not actually ſee all colours, but it is able to ſee all colours, if they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: ſo though <hi>Adam</hi> did not actually comprehend all things, yet whatſoever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he met withall, he was able clearely to paſſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon. He was able
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14441:27"/>
to conceive of any thing, that might further him in pleaſing God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherein doth this perfection of <hi>Adams</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſiſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the univerſality of it.<note place="margin">Adams perfection of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wherein.</note> He was able to underſtand all things, that were preſented to his underſtanding, and lyable to the power of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what ever might either bee neceſſary to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or order the creature. Wee muſt not think he was able to conceive the ſecret myſteries of Gods counſell, or to dive into the ſecret thoughts of any other man, or elſe to foretell things to come; this onely belongs to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Secret
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14441:28"/>
things belong to God,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. For thou alone know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the mind of all the ſonnes of men. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.7. When God did conteſt with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, hee ſaith, <hi>Let them foretell things to come;</hi> to which wee muſt not extend <hi>Adams</hi> knowledge. What ever might helpe in ruling himſelfe, and governing the creature, he had; yet we muſt not extend the knowledge of <hi>Adam</hi> to Gods ſecrets. <hi>Adam</hi> was like the governour in a Campe, who hath not onely skill to governe himſelfe, but to order all occaſions, and removings of the Campe: <hi>Adam</hi> was the Generall of Gods Camp, the birds of the heaven, and the beaſts of the field, were all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his dominion, hee had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14441:28"/>
knowledge to order them all to the ends to which they were appointed for. We that have loſt this image, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand almoſt nothing: How often are wee at a ſtand in common things? <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.10. <hi>Wee grope at noone day, as if wee had no eyes.</hi> Among the Saints, which have received ſome of this knowledge, that which they know is the leaſt part of that they know not; ſo that the accuſation of <hi>Job</hi> is againſt us, <hi>Job</hi> 26.14. <hi>What a little part doe we know of God?</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> met with no difficulty, but he was able to ſearch into the depth of it: there was no meanes uſefull for him, but hee was able to order and diſpoſe them for his good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The perfection of <hi>Adams</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:14441:29"/>
knowledge conſiſts in the certainty of it: Hee knew things according to truth, not erring, or miſ-judging; he did not onely perceive the truth of things, but he judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How often are wee cozened with the affaires of this world, and the devices of Sathan? The eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are like the mans in the Goſpel, who ſaw men like trees; but it was not ſo with <hi>Adam,</hi> there was no web in his eye, no filme upon his underſtanding, but he was furniſhed with the perfection of knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But if <hi>Adam</hi> was able to diſcover deceits, how came he to be deluded by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The cauſe of his errour
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14441:29"/>
was not becauſe he could not diſcerne, but becauſe he did not beſtow his mind upon it, and improve his wiſedome: he had wiſedome to diſcover Satans ſleights, had he kept his minde and thoughts to a conſideration thereof. Let a mans eye be never ſo cleare, yet if he conſider not of the object, it may bee hard by him, and he perceive it not: a friend ſtands by, and wee know him not, becauſe wee look not ſettledly upon him: ſo though <hi>Adam</hi> was able to diſcern the deceits of Sathan, yet his not attending made the devill put a cheat upon him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The perfection of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> underſtanding conſiſted in this, that he could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all things clearly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14441:30"/>
doubting. This is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that wee finde. Many things wee doe not know; many things that wee know, we miſtake; and thoſe things wee miſtake not, we ſee at peradventures. Looke, what is the difference between the light of the ſunne and ſtarre-light: (In ſtarre-light, if a thing be ſubtill, or ſmall, we doubt of it, but when the ſunne comes, we can perceive every thing undeniably:) ſuch was the knowledge of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby, as by the light of the ſunne, he could diſcerne without ſtaggering the things that were offered to his view. but a naturall man walkes in darkneſſe, or at moſt but by the ſtarre-light of reaſon. The beſt Saint hath but twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: wee know in part,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14441:30"/>
and underſtand in part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> The uſe is double:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of inſtruction.<note place="margin">Ignorantia non excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat à toto, ſed à tanto.</note> From hence wee learne that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will acquit no mans perſon. God made <hi>Adam</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in knowledge, therefore the ſcales of ignorance will not acquit thee. Wee that have received ſo much from God, it is requiſite we ſhould repay ſomething to God againe. Muſt men think they muſt be pardoned, becauſe of their ignorance? Alas! ſay ſome, Schollers ſhould know, but as for us, who have had no education, I hope God will not require wiſedome at our hands. No? Why? will not God looke for his owne at every mans hands? Nay, unleſſe thou wilt have God wrong his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14441:31"/>
juſtice, God doth expect, that thou that haſt received a weighty talent from him, ſhouldſt returne it to him again improved. Be it known to you therefore, that God will knocke at every mans doore, and ſay, Where is that knowledge that I gave thee? Therefore our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot excuſe us, it will condemne us rather. That it is thus, conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ignorance makes men ſtrangers from the life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. How comes it to bee ſo? Through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. An ignorant heart is a ſtranger to life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: when all the mercies of God, and his holineſſe, are propounded, it never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes with an ignorant heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

This the wiſe man preſſeth effectually, <hi>Pro</hi> 2.2. <hi>Incline thine eare to wiſedome:</hi> if ſhe will not come, then cry mightily after her: if ſhee will not heare thee, then ſeek for her as for hid treaſure.

How doth the covetous man toile to get his wealth about him, becauſe it is excellent; becauſe wiſedome is much more excellent, let us labour more to get it.

Now the faculty of the Will, is like the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14441:34"/>
hand, that puts away, or takes any thing. The will is like an unruly horſe, that caſts his rider; I will do what I will, though reaſon croſſe it. This will, whereof we now ſpeake, was graciouſly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, when it came out of the hands of God. Now for the Anſwer. <hi>Holineſſe and righteouſneſſe</hi> were imprinted in the will of <hi>Adam, Eph.</hi> 4.24. The Apoſtle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians made knowledge a part of the ſpirituall image of <hi>Adam,</hi> and now he addes <hi>holineſſe and righteouſneſſe,</hi> which were ſeated in the will, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is holineſſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> A ſpirituall power,<note place="margin">Holineſſe, what.</note> or frame put into the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> inabling him to doe Gods will, and fitting him to love God above all.</p>
               <p>Three things are in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a ſpirituall power. It is not the very nature of the faculty of the will, but a frame put into the will, that ſets it on, and carries it out to God: for the will of it ſelfe is not able to cloſe with God, but onely ſo farre as it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to him. As it is in the body, the tongue is the inſtrument of taſting; of it ſelf it cannot taſte, but there is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14441:35"/>
a moiſture there that makes it taſte; hence if it be evilly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, it taſteth evill; ſweet things ſeeme ſoure, and ſoure things ſeeme ſweet: or as it is with the hand; it cannot worke about any thing bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is an hand, unleſſe it receive ſtrength and motion from the vitall faculty: for a dead hand, or a benummed hand, can exerciſe it ſelfe about nothing: ſo it is with the will; that power of it ſelf cannot relliſh the things of life and happineſſe, but it muſt be an holy will that can cloſe with an holy God: it is not barely the will, but there muſt bee an wholeſome conſtitution put into it, and then it can cloſe with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly God, having this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame. Hence it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14441:35"/>
death to the wicked to bee under the ordinances of God. The devils have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculty of will, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption poſſeſſeth it, and therefore they abhorre the holineſſe of God, becauſe they themſelves are unholy: but <hi>Adams</hi> will had a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all frame of holineſſe put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, whereby it was able perfectly to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a readineſſe and promptneſſe put into his will, whereby hee was able eaſily to beſtow himſelfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and comfortably to bee carried unto the doing of the will of God. When the wheels of a clock are rightly ordered, they go on ſpeedily; <hi>Adam</hi> was the clocke of God, and the maine wheele was the will: when the ruſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14441:36"/>
of ſturdineſſe hangs on the will, the motion to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is hindered; but had our wills this oyle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they would runne on chearily in the ſervice of God. Men ſlight the means of grace, and cannot cloſe with the ordinances of God, becauſe their wills are unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As it is with ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. it leads a man captive to the commiſsion of evill, it puts a promptneſſe into the heart to incline it to evill: ſo holineſſe puts a quickneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will, which carries it on joyfully to performe the will of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If a man will purge himſelfe, he ſhall be a veſſell of honour fit for the Maſters uſe, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for every good worke.</hi> While a mans heart is like an
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14441:36"/>
uncleane veſſell, he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for any good work, but when his heart is purged, he is fit for every good work, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. <hi>Thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God</hi> with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and gladneſſe of heart. God will be ſerved, but with what heart? with a joyfull and a merry heart: This gladneſſe comes from the holineſſe that was in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He was by this able to love God above all; and this was the performance of the firſt Table: and this above all implies three things.<note place="margin">To love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, hath three things.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He did prize God more then what ever God could doe for him; nay, more then ſalvation it ſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26. When he was dazeled with the proſperity of the wicked,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14441:37"/>
mark what he ſayes, <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, I eſteeme of God above all. A man makes an high account of his patrimony, ſo doth <hi>David</hi> eſteeme of God.<note place="margin">Pſa. 73.26</note>
                  <hi>If a man love father, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then mee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> 
                  <hi>hee is not worthy of mee:</hi> nay, a man muſt love God-better then his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is better then life,</hi> then the life of my wife, then the life of my child, nay it it is better then mine owne life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He made choice of God above all. As a man prizeth a thing, ſo hee will make choice of it: When we come into a ſhop, look what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity wee prize, wee will take; ſo was <hi>Adams</hi> choice
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14441:37"/>
of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> The renewed ſoule counts all things dung and droſſe, in compariſon of Chriſt. <hi>Adam</hi> had by vertue of this frame, that power, that if all the world were offered him, yet hee would chuſe God above all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hee was able to have his heart carryed with great intention of ſoule, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his minde upon the Lord. When <hi>Adam</hi> did chuſe God above all, then hee had power to have his heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with greateſt extent of ſtrength to him; for thus it is commanded, by our Saviour to the Lawyer in the Goſpel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy might, &amp; with all thy ſtrength:</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14441:38"/>
ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> carried with the utmoſt of his ſtrength to cloſe with God. If God ſhould have threatned, <hi>Adam</hi> would have trembled; if hee ſhould have revealed his goodneſſe, <hi>Adam</hi> would have been inlarged in love thereof; if hee ſhould have revealed his name, <hi>Adam</hi> would have honoured it. This frame of his will made him carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe proportionably to Gods will to the utmoſt of his ſtrength. A man muſt love his neighbour with his whole heart, not with ſome of it, yet not with his whole ſtrength: A man may love his neighbour too much; but when hee comes to the love of God, he muſt love him as much as he can. <hi>Adam</hi> ought to have loved his neighbour
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14441:38"/>
with his whole heart, yet it was not required of <hi>Adam</hi> to love his neighbour as his wife; but for his God, he was to beſtow his whole ſtrength upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print this upon <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Holineſſe why im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on Adam.</note> becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> without this meaſure of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe could not returne that tribute of holineſſe he owed as a reaſonable creature, and which God expected as a Creatour. There is a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God expects at the hands of a creature, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, praiſe: for as Landlords let out their lands for rents which they expect at their tenants hands; ſo doth God require thankſgiving from <hi>Adam,</hi> which, unleſſe he had holineſſe, he could not have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14441:39"/>
given. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.12. When he had diſcovered the largeneſſe of Gods love, marke what he gathers, <hi>And now, oh Iſrael, what doth the Lord thy God require, but to love him with thy whole heart?</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, This I looke for, that for all my kindneſſe, thou feare mee, and love me with thy whole heart; which to doe is a Chriſtians Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. Had God made <hi>Adam</hi> ſo, that hee could not have loved him, he could not have received honour from him, and ſo had beene acceſſary to the diſhonour of his owne name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> by this meanes attained his owne good. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie things never leave mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, till they come to the earth; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14441:39"/>
before he came to enjoy union with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was <hi>Adams,</hi> and is our happineſſe, to enjoy God; which is the onely good of a mans ſoule. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8 <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee.</hi> The up-ſhot of the deſires of Gods ſervants is towards his name: when the body is in the grave, and the ſoule in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the ſoule would faine be united to the body, that both may be united to God, and be poſſeſſed of him, and then all deſires ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe if <hi>Adam</hi> had not had this holineſſe, God had required more of him, then he had ability to performe; which had beene a want of equity, which is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming the ſweet nature
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14441:40"/>
of God. To require a thing abſolutely impoſſible, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt equity: had not <hi>Adam</hi> had power to love God, God requiring love from him, had required that of him, which he had not beene able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. It ſtood with equity, and Gods righteous will, to give <hi>Adam</hi> power to love him above all; yea it was a debt God owed to him, ſeeing he would require obedience from him. When <hi>Adam</hi> had not offended, it was requiſite God ſhould give him ability to diſcharge his ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> The uſe hence is,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">No ſhame to be holy.</note>1. For inſtruction, to teach us, that it is no ſhame to be holy; holineſſe is no mans diſhonour. It is the greateſt praiſe that can befall a man, to be holy: to be like God is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14441:40"/>
no diſhonour, and by holineſs we come to be moſt like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. It is one of Gods names, <hi>The holy One of Iſrael, Iſa</hi> 43.14. Nay the Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. doe not ſay, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, powerfull, but <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hoſtes:</hi> the Lord is ſaid there to be the <hi>God of hoſtes,</hi> but he is three times holy, for his one time powerfull; not that holineſſe is more in God, then power, but to ſhew how God rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in this name <hi>Holy.</hi> Who art thou then that art loath to have the name of holineſſe? Yes, you are one of the holy crew, will they ſay. Art thou an enemy to holineſſe? then thou art an ungodly man. The venome of ſuch mens ſpirits as hate holineſſe, is incomparable: there is no

but ſhall bee in an unholy place, among unholy Divels. Know thy ſinne to bee hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and thy judgement heavie.</p>

               <p>In the deſcription there are three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the ſecond part of Gods image in the will. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14441:45"/>
fitted <hi>Adam</hi> to goe to God, yet, of it ſelfe, it could not fit him to love his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore hee muſt have another frame, that is, of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is beyond the power of the ſoule to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſpirituall love to his brother; therefore it muſt have this part of Gods image in it: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Love is of God:</hi> to love another holily, is beyond the power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of nature. Indeed, a man may love another car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as adulterers; and naturally, as creatures; but to love another ſpiritually, hee muſt have power from God. There is a double cunning of the hand (as <hi>David</hi> uſeth the word) a cunning to play on an inſtrument,<note place="margin">Pſa. 137.</note> and a cunning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14441:46"/>
to write; now the cunning of the one will not make a man skilfull in the other: ſo there is a double cunning put into the heart of <hi>Adam;</hi> the firſt <hi>Of holineſſe,</hi> whereby hee could love God above all: the ſecond, <hi>Of righteouſneſſe,</hi> whereby he could love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as hee ought, and his neighbour as himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of the deſcription was, By this he was fitted to love himſelfe as he ought. The ground of all lawfull love comes from ſelf-love, if it be pure. There is a ſelfe-love required; nay, if it be right, it is the ſtandard of all love to another: He that loveth himſelfe as he ſhould, will be diſpoſed to love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Love lookes firſt at that which is moſt good to

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A man muſt love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a right order, and that you muſt underſtand in three rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. He muſt love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the ſecond place, God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14441:47"/>
in the firſt, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with the firſt fruits of thy increaſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdome of heaven,</hi> all elſe muſt be ſerved after God. In the old law it was required, that God ſhould have the firſt fruits of a mans vintage. We muſt beſtow the chiefeſt of our love and delight on God: we muſt love Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the firſt place, our owne in the ſecond, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.38. <hi>This is the firſt and greateſt commandement, To love God with all our heart: The ſecond is like unto this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt love himſelfe with a ſubordinate degree of love: but in the love of God he muſt put forth the utmoſt of his ſtrength. In the old law, hee that brought a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14441:47"/>
was to bring a male, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. ult. <hi>Curſed be the man that hath a male in his flocke, and offereth a female to the Lord,</hi> The male is the ſtronger, the female the weaker. All our prayers and ſervices unto God, muſt bee male; but fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male love and deſire will ſerve our ſelves. God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the old law, that the ſacrifices ſhould not be ſhorn: our ſacrifices are our duties to God, (they are the males we muſt offer) we may not ſheare our joy and delight, but let them go with their fleeces on, that is, in their full ſtrength to God; but when we come to our ſelves, we may ſheare our love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man is to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in God, and for God. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was to love Gods image
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14441:48"/>
in himſelfe, as a ſtep to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh him more ſpeedily to the love of God. What wouldeſt thou love in thy ſelfe? thine honour? Get thee to a wiſe and glorious God, and love his glory more. Doſt thou love thy life? Oh love the life of God, who is a living God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. <hi>I could wiſh to bee Anathema for my brethren, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing that the Jewes would fall to the diſhonour of God, hee did ſo prize the honour of God, that he could wiſh himſelfe to be accurſed, that they might ſtand. This was the cauſe hee loved the glory of God above all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had power to love himſelfe in a right meaſure. This I referre to all thoſe things, which concerne <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:14441:48"/>
in compariſon with his fellow brethren.</p>
               <p>In this right meaſure two rules are to be attended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Adam</hi> was to love all things belonging to himſelf, with a love proportionable to them: He was to proportion his love ſutable to the nature of the things. As one excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another in goodneſſe, ſo hee was to exceed in love towards them. Thoſe things that were of the choiceſt nature, on them he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the choiceſt affections; as for example, <hi>Adam</hi> was to love his life, honour, and good name, according to their nature: A man muſt love his life above his wealth, and the good of his ſoule above his life. As in a paire of ſcales the heavier the waight is in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14441:49"/>
the one, the more weight we put into the other, if wee would have them even: ſo, anſwerable to the love that was in any thing, <hi>Adam</hi> was to weigh out an agreeable proportion of love. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the ſoule is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, therefore he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow unchangeable love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: but wealth and riches are mutable, therefore muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections wil ſerve them; we muſt ſo love them, as to be content to leave them. Thy wife is dearer then thy kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, weigh out the affections of matrimony to thy wife, of friendſhip to thy kinſman. The credit of the world is good, but it is but a ſmall good; weigh out but a little meaſure of love to it. The woman ſicke of a bloudy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14441:49"/>
iſſue ſpent all ſhe had to ſave her life; and ſhall not a man ſpend his life to ſave his ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. We ought to love our owne perſonall good, more then the good of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All true love begins at home: I muſt love mine own honour, more then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of another.</p>
               <p>For the right underſtanding of this Rule, take notice of two cautions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut.</hi> 1. I muſt alwayes compare my good with the good of another in the ſame kind: I muſt compare my life and his life, my ſoule and his ſoule: My owne ſoule is dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to me then anothers. But if you take them not in the like quality, the rule bindes not. I muſt love the ſoule of my brother more then
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14441:50"/>
mine owne life. If a man might undoubtedly ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſalvation of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by laying downe his life, he muſt be content to dye: ſo likewiſe I muſt love the life of my brother better then mine owne riches. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them in the ſame kind, and the rule holds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caut.</hi> 2. There muſt be no overpowring circumſtance to overſway mee, if the publicke good may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, or God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured more by him then by me, in regard of his parts and place: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>We ought to lay downe our lives for our brethren.</hi> When God may receive more honour from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man then from me, I muſt lay downe my life to ſave his. It was requiſite a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14441:50"/>
private Chriſtian, ſhould die rather then <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, becauſe hee was chiefe; if therefore a private man ſhould reſcue <hi>Paul,</hi> he muſt lay downe his life for him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. The life of king <hi>David</hi> is better, then the life of a thouſand ſubjects; Gods honour may be more promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it. The arme will looſe it ſelfe, to ſave the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. We muſt love our ſelves in a right manner;<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves.</note> namely, in that manner that is comely and beſeeming.

Out of ſelfe-love and pride you muſt not have your baſe courſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but you hate your ſoules in deſpiſing the means. God is Jehovah, a <hi>Being</hi> God, therefore requires that mans love ſhould be reall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> loved himſelfe <hi>fervently,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.22.</note> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls it. There was, namely, a <hi>preſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:14441:51"/>
in <hi>Adams</hi> ſpirit, whereby the whole man was carried to improve any meanes for the good of himſelfe. <hi>Adam</hi> was free from weakneſſe within, from impediment without. As in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. it is called, <hi>The labour of love,</hi> ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> painfull to uſe all meanes for his good. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.29. <hi>No man ever hated his owne fleſh; but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it,</hi> that is, hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes all meanes to helpe himſelfe: whereas wee that are corrupt, cannot inlarge our hearts in duties of love. We are ſo diſtracted, that we cannot go on freely in our oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, both in things that concerne God, and in things that concerne our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good we would do, we doe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:14441:52"/>3. <hi>Adam</hi> loved himſelfe purely, not with carnall nor ſenſuall love. He loved onely that which was good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: he loved his excellency, that ſo he might get more of it, and be fitted by it in the performance of his ſervice. There are ſixe good things belonging to a man; Honour, Life, Chaſtity, Goods, Good name, Proſperity: now <hi>Adam</hi> loved theſe, that hee might get more of them, and be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the better for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Theſe two things <hi>Adam</hi> got by obedience: 1. more ability: 2. more dexterity in the performance of Gods command. <hi>Adam</hi> loved his honour, that he might receive more honour from others, and be more enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his duty to them;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14441:52"/>
whereas we love good things for naughty ends. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous churle loveth his ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping humour, and growes more covetous: we love ſin, which we ought to abhorre, and we doe good oftentimes for bad ends; but <hi>Adam</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that which was good in himſelfe, for that good end, to get more of it. Gods people are <hi>followers after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 51.11.</note> More of that (Lord) more chaſtity and meekneſſe. As the beaſt that hunts his prey, purſues it ſtill with more and more eagerneſſe, ſo doth the gracious man follow after righteouſneſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, &amp;c. but yet he deſired more: wee love good things wel, but many times uſe them ill when wee have them. A man perhaps craves honour
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14441:53"/>
with moderation, but he lifts up his heart, when hee hath gotten it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Part</hi> 3. The third thing in the deſcription, is, He loved his brother as himſelfe; for quality, not for quantity. The love of himſelfe was a patern to imitate, not to equall or exceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may we know how <hi>Adam</hi> was to love his brother as himſelfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The rules are two.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">How to love our brother as our ſelves</note>1. He was to weigh out love, reſpecting as well his brothers good as his owne.

Wert thou in diſgrace, thou wouldeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire reputation: have the like deſire for the credit of thy brother. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.29. <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul) that all that hear me this day, were altogether as I am:</hi> altogether holy, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether aſſured of Gods love. Here is an heart, ſuch an one as <hi>Adam</hi> had in perfection: it was as if hee ſhould have ſaid, I would to God that all that heare me this day, had the like evidence of Gods goodneſſe. We ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that what good befals us, might happen to our brethren
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14441:54"/>
alſo, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.29. <hi>I would to God that all the people of the Lord were Prophets.</hi> So, haſt thou honour? ſay, I would to God all Gods ſervants had honour too. Is thy ſoul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted? ſay, Oh that all Gods ſervants were ſo! we thinke our candles burne the worſe, becauſe others burne bright. This was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ought not to be in us; wee ſhould rejoice in the good of others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.8. <hi>They rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with her:</hi> we muſt rejoice in the proſperity of others. <hi>Adam</hi> had the heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the good of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wee ought to doe the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt be painefull to promote the good of our fellow-brethren, as our own. Love is ſolicitous and full of

               <p>

In a building, all the parts muſt bee pinned together, otherwiſe one part will not uphold another: ſo it is in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, there muſt be inlets of love to uphold it: wee muſt bee ſouldred together with loving affections, elſe there is no continuing of ſociety. The deſolation of kingdoms, the ruine of nations, whence comes it, but from want of love? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes love a matter of excellency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>I ſhew to you a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way.

               <p>The uſe is threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It falls heavie upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wicked and ungodly men,<note place="margin">Malicious men have not Gods image on them.</note> the vileneſſe of whoſe hearts

The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are the children of love, the children of Satan are the children of hatred. Hee that hateth his brother,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14441:56"/>
is a childe of the Devill, it is manifeſt, thou maiſt conclude it undoubtedly. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Thou that haſt no love, haſt no intereſt in God. Hatred is that wherein the kingdome of Satan conſiſts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.41. as for all other ſins, they are practiſed among men, but this is the trade of the Devils in hell. The Phariſees bragged that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>You ſeeke to kill me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, which <hi>Abraham</hi> did not: <hi>if you were of your father Abraham, you would doe the workes of Abraham:</hi> but marke the 44. verſe: <hi>You are of your father the Devill: for hee was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer from the beginning.</hi> You have never heard, that

Sathan ſtabbed a man, but his murther was, Hee maligned <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency: this therefore is a devilliſh ſinne.

This is the very brand of a wretch. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a caſt away, as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14441:57"/>
the text plainly ſpeaks: what was his guiſe? He perſecuted the ſonne of Promiſe, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him with a railing tongue; for this the Scripture often calls <hi>perſecution:</hi> and this is the note of a man born after the fleſh, who ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee Gods face; for the Text ſaith, <hi>Cast him out.</hi> Envie and malice is the ſinne of the Devill, and it is the note of a reprobate: the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke upon us, that wee ſeeing our owne miſery, may ſtrive for power againſt it, and get love from God, that we may be poſſeſſed of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe with him.</p>

to bee expected from a wicked man. Love is another matter then men make of it; it is a grace above nature, which no man can expreſſe, unleſſe God put this image into the ſoule. Love comes from righteouſneſſe; We had as good look for honey in an hornets neſt, or in a ſerpents den, or ſweet fruit from a crab-ſtocke, as love from an unrighteous man: unleſſe the root of righteouſneſſe bee within, love cannot bee without, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>You that have purified your hearts, &amp;c. love one another with a pure heart.</hi> Firſt we muſt have an heart purified by the ſpirit, and then we muſt love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: if purity be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, love cannot be without; therefore delude not your

If thou ſeeſt a mans life profane, let him pretend what kindneſſe he wil, let him promiſe golden mountaines, he will never love thee. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> behaved himſelfe wiſely, ſo that <hi>Saul</hi> confeſſed him to be righteous; yet unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe was in <hi>Sauls</hi> heart, and he (againſt reaſon) perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted him as a partridge on the mountaines. <hi>Judas,</hi> that lived in the boſome of our Saviour, and never received evill from him, (which a man would have thought ſhould have wrought upon him) yet loving money more then Chriſt, hee ſold him for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie peeces of ſilver. Never truſt a wicked man, for he will ſell thee for ſixe pence. Doe not thinke with thy ſelfe, I will walke ſo carefully,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14441:59"/>
that I will binde him to my love: Oh poore creature, thou canſt not have what he cannot do: unleſſe thou canſt give him a righteous heart, thou canſt never receive love from him. If a man have an horſe that is ſurfetted within, or is lame of his legges, feed him with the beſt provender, he will halt ſtill, unleſſe his lameneſſe be cured.

Freewill to doe good is the garland of all graces,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14441:61"/>
and is made up of them. We may eaſily perceive it by the want of it; for we hang back, and cannot be brought to the performance of ſervice due to God. <hi>Adam</hi> had a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will, which was the excellency and beauty of wiſdome, holineſſe, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">What it is.</note>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a ſpeciall priviledge proceeding from the image of God in <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he was able to chuſe any good without any impediment, yet after a mutable manner.</p>
               <p>In this deſcription are foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a ſpeciall priviledge proceeding from the image of God, <hi>viZ.</hi> holineſſe, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and wiſedome. The ſtatelineſſe of a building
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14441:61"/>
comes from all the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; beat down the parts, and it will bee an heape of ſtones: ſo freewill is the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that God put on <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe beauty flowes from the joyning together of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, holineſſe, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. This was a ſpeciall priviledge to <hi>Adam:</hi> no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beſides him and Angels, had free liberty to doe good. God put this ſtocke into his hand. When I ſay <hi>Adam</hi> had this ſpeciall priviledge, I do not ſay therefore he was free from ſubjection to God; for God gave <hi>Adam</hi> a law, and concurred with him in his worke; but the diſpenſation of the worke God left to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> liberty: if he did well he ſhould be rewarded; if he did ill, he ſhould be puniſhed.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14441:62"/>
God would not conſtrain <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to his ſervice, nor compel him to evill. The other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could not meddle with him, for they were under him; therefore he was free. Hence the Philoſopher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that praiſe and diſpraiſe belongs onely to man. Wee praiſe not the fire for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe it is tyed to it by a bond of neceſſity; but <hi>Adam</hi> might doe, or not doe; if he did well, he was to bee praiſed, becauſe hee might have done evill: if hee did evill, he was to be diſpraiſed, becauſe he might have done well. Still God concurres with <hi>Adam,</hi> as he doth with the nature of the creatures: he workes with the fire when it burnes, with the ſparrow when it flyes: for ſo it is in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14441:62"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>where the ſpirit is, there is liberty:</hi> there is a ſoveraignty in the will of a regenerate man, by which all creatures are under his diſpoſe, which God will not, the creature cannot hinder: Therefore Chriſt ſaith unto the beleeving Jewes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>If you heare my words you are free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee was enabled to chuſe any thing that was good. Freedome is not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the underſtanding; therefore the deſcription ſaith. He chuſeth good; which is an act of the will. The will can imbrace nothing, but what the underſtanding preſents unto it, 'tis true; but it is as true, that the liberty of freedome lyes mainely in the will: For example, when a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14441:63"/>
man hath diſputed what a duty is, and hath concluded it, he preſents this unto the will, which either allowes or rejects it; ſo that ſtill the choice lyeth in the will. It is eaſie to convince a mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, all the difficulty is in the will: The will ſaith obſtinately, I will not heare upon that eare. If the Judge be unjuſt, hee will have the Jury bring in a verdict accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his minde. When the underſtanding hath obſerved what is true, and tells the heart, You muſt not doe thus or thus; the will ſaith, I muſt have another verdict: ſo that the root of liberty is mainely in the will. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>I have ſet life and death before you, chuſe life, &amp;c.</hi> That is, the bleſſings are many if you

obey; the curſes are many, if you diſobey: therefore chuſe the good way. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Was it not in thy power, &amp;c?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, It was in thy choice to have given, or not to have given. I adde, that the will of <hi>Adam</hi> could chuſe any good, whether naturall, morall, or heavenly; the two former remaines in us, but <hi>Adam</hi> was further enabled to chuſe holy things. There was no command, but hee was able to obey, nor no truth but hee was able to chuſe. Good is the food of the will, <hi>Adam</hi> was able to diſgeſt any good with full content: and herein mainely conſiſts liberty, for a man to chuſe that which is good: It is no liberty for a man to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on headily to evill. Men
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14441:64"/>
eſteeme none ſo free, as they that chuſe what they liſt. I will chuſe bad as well as good, ſaith one; I will profane an holy-day as well as ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; but this is not free-will, to be hurried on to evill. In 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would give a man free liberty to doe any thing, and yet goe to heaven, as the Text ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.19</note>

The Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are moſt free in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty: they are ſo confirmed, that they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14441:64"/>
cannot love evill; nay, God himſelfe wills good moſt freely. There are no bounds to his will, and yet he cannot but will good: therefore when wee are able to will good moſt freely, wee are moſt free. He is a free man, that is able to follow good, beyond perſecutions and temptations. The other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of liberty is a very falſe one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Without any impediment.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments in chuſing good.</note> This is a great bleſſing, to be able to embrace good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hinderance. Nothing could croſſe <hi>Adam</hi> in his courſe. A man may binde anothers hands, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command the will. There was this ſpeciall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Adams</hi> will, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could thwart him. Now
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14441:65"/>
this appeares in foure things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was no weakneſſe in him to diſable him: there was no good to be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the depth of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and reach of his will. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16. <hi>David</hi> had that feebleneſſe of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that it was too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for him, to obſerve the difference of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but this was not in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was no ſtirre of corruption, that could oppoſe him: corruption is like a backe-byas, that hinders our courſe. The Saints of God finde alwayes ſome ſtirrings of corruption ſtill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in duty; but it was not ſo in <hi>Adam. Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit.</hi> This every Saint of God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14441:65"/>
findes: for when he would be humble, then pride ſtirres, &amp;c. it was otherwiſe with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There was no ſtrength of corruption that might foile him; but our corruptions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile over us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I ſee another law leading mee captive unto the law of ſinne.</hi> Mans proud heart makes him vent wrathfull words, and foyles him; but <hi>Adam</hi> had no power of corruption to foyle him. As it is with a ſhip well trimmed, if winde and tide ſerve, it goes on amain: ſo <hi>Adams</hi> heart was full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, which carried him forward to good amaine: he had ſea-roome to inlarge himſelfe in the choice of good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There was nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14441:66"/>
to ſtop <hi>Adam</hi> in what he would. The Divell might offer a temptation to <hi>Adam,</hi> but he could offer no compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: he might ſee, if he could perſwade him, but he could not force him. When the ſerpent ſpoke with <hi>Eve,</hi> if ſhe had reſiſted him, he would have gone from her. For <hi>Adam</hi> had the ſoveraigne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the creatures, the Divell only uſurpt it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had nothing within, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without to hinder him.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing in the deſcription is, that it was <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a mutable manner.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Adam</hi> was able, as to chuſe any good which God had revealed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, ſo to entertaine any evill, and commit it. It was with <hi>Adams</hi> liberty as with a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14441:66"/>
paire of ſcales that are equall; if you put more into the one then the other, you will eaſily make the one ſinke and the other riſe: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was in an even poize, he might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to good, if hee would exerciſe that power he had; and he might turne himſelfe towards evill, if hee would abuſe that liberty he had.</p>
               <p>For the opening of this, two queſtions may be ſcanned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What was the ground of the manner of this choice of good and evill in <hi>Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It lay in the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and flowed from that mutability which was in the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was a reaſonable creature. Though nothing could force <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:14441:67"/>
to turne from a good courſe, yet there was a mutability joyned with his liberty, that he might turne himſelfe from God. <hi>Solomon</hi> having diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the deceit of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſuppoſing it demanded whence it came? He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. ult</note>
                  <hi>I know, that God made man upright, but he ſought out inventions:</hi> inventions were of his owne deviſing, not of Gods ordering. Nothing in the world could compell man to doe it; but hee <hi>ſought out</hi> crooked wayes. This was intended in the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. the Lord ſet two trees in the garden: firſt, the tree of life, to intimate, that as verily as he ſaw that tree, ſo verily, if he loved God, hee ſhould live for ever; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14441:67"/>
the tree of knowledge of good and evill, to wit, if hee did eat of that fruit, hee ſhould know what it was to have the image of God, and what to bee deprived of it. Theſe two Sacraments inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that God had ſet life and death before <hi>Adam;</hi> hee might chuſe the one, and refuſe the other. Our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſignifie not ſo. Baptiſm ſignifies our implanting into Chriſt, the Lords Supper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our growth in Chriſt: but in the Sacraments of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the one ſhewed a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility he had to live, the other the poſſibility he had to dye. This mutability was no part of the liberty of <hi>Adam;</hi> for it deſtroyed his liberty: but it was a quality, that did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the condition of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:14441:68"/>
                  <hi>Darkneſſe was upon the face of the deepe.</hi> The text doth not ſay, God created dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but it did accompany the creature naturally: ſo did this mutability accompany <hi>Adam.</hi> Immutability belongs to God onely, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, he found no ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe in his Angels: mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability therefore belongs to the creature, as a creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how did this ſtand with the perfection of <hi>Adams</hi> nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Marvellous well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſparagement to the image of God; nay, he could be no other. It was no ſinne in <hi>Adam</hi> to be mutable, but that he abuſed all, when hee might have uſed it to Gods glory. It was ſo farre from being a blemiſh to <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14441:68"/>
that it agreed very conveniently with it. Herein appeares the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate, the eſtate of the Saints glorified, and the wicked now damned. <hi>Adam</hi> was to trade for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable condition, therefore could not have it put into his hand at firſt. The Saints that have fought the fight of faith, are eſtabliſhed, and never ſhall doe evill, becauſe they have performed obedience unto God through Chriſt: The damned, becauſe they have ſinned againſt God, and have withdrawne themſelves from his authority, are immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably evill; for God hath ſeparated himſelfe, all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and the meanes of grace from them, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them up to the power of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14441:69"/>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe without it, <hi>Adams</hi> obedience could not have beene acceptable: <hi>The Lord loves,</hi> as <hi>a cheerfull giver,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7.</note> ſo a cheerfull performer of ſervice.

All Gods ſervants muſt be Volunteers, not preſt. As <hi>Deborah, Jud.</hi> 5.4. <hi>My ſoule is with thoſe that offer themſelves willingly.</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:14441:70"/>
We abhorre it in our ſervants when they come to their worke as a Beare to the ſtake, and will God accept it at our hands? All the offerings of God muſt be freewill offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Thus our Saviour did, that knew how to pleaſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I am deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to doe thy will, O my God, and thy law is within my heart.</hi> He comes not off with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,<note place="margin">Joh. 4.34.</note> but ſaith <hi>It is my meat and drinke to doe thy will.</hi> When you are at a feaſt, you can ſit at it houre after houre; ſo if our duties be as our meat and our drinke, they will not be tedious to us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.7. Wee muſt <hi>ſerve God with a goodwill:</hi> It is an unſeemely thing, to cauſe God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine for his ſervice. God will have his praiſe out of a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14441:70"/>
proud heart: but then God honours himſelfe, we honour him not. The Devill himſelf will do duties after this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. it is ſaid, the Devill came alſo. He would have been ranging and raging about the world, but God made him come alſo. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. <hi>We know that thou art the Son of God:</hi> God wreſted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion out of him. It is not acceptable, when we are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to duty; the Devill doth ſo: the ſervice that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts is done willingly. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve the Lord with a glad heart,</hi> and be carried on full ſayle in the wayes of godlineſſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Though many times by the violence of Occaſions, the Saints are ſurprized, yet they have hearts to approve of the good, they cannot do. This is that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. ult. If a man, ſaith he, hath Religion, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and rayleth againſt Gods truth, hee deceives himſelfe; but <hi>this is pure religion to keep a mans ſelfe unſpotted.</hi> Looke as it is with a City beſieged, when it is taken, the enemies make thoſe that are in the city ſweare to their King; if now
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14441:74"/>
a man reſolves to take his death, rather then the oath, he keepes himſelfe unſpotted from treaſon. So Sathan by long ſiege tranſports the heart unto the commiſſion of evill; yet the ſoule keepes it ſelfe untainted, when it chuſes the good it cannot do. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.25. if an adulterer offer a rape to a Virgin, the ſinne is his that forced her, it lies not on the party forced: ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in a ſort forceth the ſoule to the commiſſion of evill: if therefore thine heart beare it as a burthen, the fault is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans and not thine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet the ſoule takes part with the word againſt both the temptations, that would inveigle it, &amp; the corruptions, that would foyle it. As it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth all good, ſo it joynes

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſoule gets the upper hand of evill. <hi>David</hi> was never adulterous more, <hi>Peter</hi> never denied his maſter more; the ſoule not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes infirmities outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſubdues the diſtempers inwardly. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>18. <hi>Hee keepes himſelfe, that the evill one touch him not.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the authority of father and mother. Thirdly, ſhee is not to perform what ſervice they will require, but what her husband requires: ſo the ſoule muſt forſake the houſe of ſin. If thou wert married to Chriſt, thou wouldſt loathe the place, and abhorre the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of thoſe that goe down into hell themſelves, and lead others with them. I ſay, if a man were married to Chriſt,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14441:76"/>
hee would not bee under the authority of corruption, but being delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne, will utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it.</p>

The former truth ſhould force every ſoule to imploy the beſt of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gaine this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Will any man be a free man? let him be an holy man. Bee ſure of the one, and thou canſt not miſſe of the other; and where the one is not, the other cannot bee. Liberty ſhould bee like a load-ſtone, to draw us to it. Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſlavery; then if we would bee freed from it, let us get holineſſe.

Wee are all captives, taken by the policy of Satan; Let us make a gathering out of the ſtock of the prayers of Gods ſervants; and let thine owne prayer bee, Oh guide and direct mee how to get power againſt my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

ſell that you have, what ever it coſt you, that you may bee free men in Chriſtianitie. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. <hi>If you continue in my words, you ſhall be free;</hi> To continue in Gods word, is to ſubmit to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the truth; for if we doe thus, we are free.

But <hi>Adam</hi> was able to hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14441:81"/>
in a right pitch. This <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. when he had wounded his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>Oh ſtabliſh mee with thy free ſpirit!</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: Time was, when I did love thy Word, mine heart did feare evill, and I did hate uncleanneſſe; but now, how unſtedfaſt are my affections! therefore <hi>ſtabliſh mee with thy free ſpirit.</hi> If you finde your hearts giving way to any baſe luſts, you ſhall finde them eaſily giving back from holy duties. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.31. <hi>Thou haſt forſaken thy firſt love:</hi> O woe to that declining condition; that thoſe who heretofore expreſſed forwardneſſe in a good courſe, and could cry for mercy as for life, are now key-cold: But <hi>Adams</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were able to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14441:82"/>
in full ſtrength: and ſo did the Saints of God. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.24. Caleb <hi>followed God fully. Pſalm.</hi> 63.9. <hi>My ſoule followes hard after thee.</hi> Hee purſued God with eagerneſſe, as the creature the prey. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſtands not ſtill, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, but purſueth; and as the phraſe is, (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.1.) <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after righteouſneſſe.</hi> Thou that haſt a ſtubborne heart by nature, if thou beeſt once righteous, thou wilt then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after meekneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His affections were in an orderly tractableneſſe to the rule of reaſon and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Reaſon and holineſſe gave not only direction to the affections, but moderation in all things, and upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons The affections would not bee carried out of order
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14441:82"/>
nor meaſure upon any thing, nor ſtay longer then they ſhould upon any object. An Embaſſador goes no farther then his Commiſſion, ſtayes no longer then his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives leave: ſo reaſon and holineſſe were the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Adams</hi> affections; they received a command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and went no further then reaſon and holineſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. It is lawfull for a man to love the world; but no more then reaſon and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe allowes: if God ſhould ſay, I will take away theſe things from thee, love and joy ſhould willingly part with them. The ſouldier, if he be loyall, when the Commander biddeth battell, hee goes; when hee ſoundeth a retrait, he returnes home againe: ſo
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14441:83"/>
the reaſon and will ſanctified, were the commanders of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> courſe. When reaſon and holineſſe ſaith it, a man may delight in the things of this life; but when they ſay, grieve no more for the loſſe of them, the affections ſhould yeeld to the command of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It is quite contrary in us; a mans affections, though they are ſet upon a lawfull object, yet they goe ſo amaine like unruly colts, that they caſt the rider: delight and deſire out-bid reaſon, and ſometimes tranſgreſſe the bounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, moſt commonly of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. It is marvellous hard to have our affections at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Lot</hi> goes into Sodom, and God could not get him out againe, but that the Angel was faine to carry him
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14441:83"/>
out by force: ſo when a man gets into Sodom, lets looſe his affections on ſhoppe, or children, or the like, oh what an hard matter is it to ſay, No more of that! But <hi>Adams</hi> affections were ſo ordered, that if reaſon ſhould ſay, Love that now, and then leave it; hee would love it now, and leave it then. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.12. <hi>I know how to abound, and how to bee poore;</hi> his meaning is, if God would beſtow theſe things, he had an heart to love them; if hee would take them away, he was content to leave them. <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord;</hi> whereas wee ſit <hi>Rachel</hi>-like, diſquieted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our comforts are not.</p>

examination.<note place="margin">By order in thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, eſteeme what grace thou haſt.</note> A man may here plainely perceive what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace hee hath, and whether hee hath any or no: See what tractableneſſe there is in thy affections, to ſubmit unto the authority of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So much boyſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as thou findeſt againſt the evidence of reaſon, and frame of holineſſe; ſo much corruption there is in thy heart. I ſpeak this the rather, to take off the conceit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who uſe to commend a man in this manner; Hee is an holy man, but that hee hath one fault, hee is as dogged as may be: it is but a poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. So much boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as is in thine heart, ſo much want of grace is there. He is a good Chriſtian (they will ſay) but wonderfull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14441:84"/>
ſurely then there is but little good in him. The ſervant is ſtubborne againſt his Maſter, the maſter againe is quarrelſome for every word: if there bee grace in theſe, it is well; yet there is a great deale of the want of Gods image upon ſuch a ſoule: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>When there are ſtrifes and envyings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, are ye not carnall?</hi> When the heart is boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and full of envie, is it not carnall? There is a great deal of rubbiſh in thy heart, which grace, if it were there, would remove. The Philoſopher obſerves, that all ſtormes are here below in theſe baſer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there is none of them in the higheſt heavens: ſo, hadſt thou an heavenly heart, all thunderings and lightenings,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14441:85"/>
all croſſe, dogged, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſtempers would bee gone, there would bee no newes of them. <hi>The fruits of the Spirit are love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> 
                  <hi>meekneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> But when men runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt, the Maſter his way, and the Servant his way, where are the fruits of the Spirit? Are ye not carnall?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But may not a man by education or miſery bee tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and cooled from theſe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, he may have the ruggedneſſe of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſmoothed, and the edge of furiouſneſſe blunted. But though a man may have theſe ſomewhat abated, and want grace, yet if a man have theſe, it is ſomewhat ſuſpicious, whether hee have grace. There may bee a root, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14441:85"/>
yet no bloſſomes, and yet it is certaine, where there are bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes there is a root. If a man expreſſe envie in his life, there is ſure a treaſure of it in his heart. If there be ſo much filth in the ſtreames, there is more in the fountain: if there be good in thee, there is but a little.</p>
               <p>Here we may alſo ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee have any truth of grace: judge of it by the works. No fire but will burn: fire will heate the whole houſe; ſo grace will frame the whole ſoule. Art thou able to tame thoſe jarring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to ſtifle them? Art thou able, when they would tranſport thee, to allay them, and bring thy ſoule to a calme frame? Then it is a ſigne thou haſt grace. God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14441:86"/>
is the God of order, not only in the Church, but in the houſe, and every where. If thou canſt maſter thoſe boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous affections, that they may be ſubject unto wiſdome and holineſſe, then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, there is ſome grace in thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But are not the beſt men troubled with paſſions and diſtempers?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in the godly and others.</note>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are ſuch in the beſt, upon whom the Lord hath beene pleaſed to look graciouſly: but they are in a farre different manner in them, then in the wicked. Their ſpots are different: <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Their ſpot is not like the ſpot of my children:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the Saints have their ſpots, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked have their ſpots; but they
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14441:86"/>
are not the ſame. The ſpots of the purples are dangerous, but the ſpots of the plague are deadly. The wicked have the ſpots of the plague; the Lord have mercy on them, they are but dead men. Though a Common-wealth bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to conſpiracies, yet a wiſe Kng can diſcover them; but when there is no King, (as in Iſrael) every man doth what he liſt: ſo in the heart of an ungodly man, corruptions do what they liſt, they make him as proud, and as covetous as they liſt. The Saints have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mutinies in their hearts, yet they have a wiſe King, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will that quels theſe, and ſubmits to God, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his grace.</p>
               <p>The difference betweene the diſtempers of the Saints
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14441:87"/>
and the wicked, appeares in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Saints make thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and unruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which lye upon them, their greateſt burthen; it is their heart-ſmart, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are greater: and the reaſon is, becauſe they break the union between God and the ſoule, and they breed a diſtance between Gods good Spirit and it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. God ſuffered Sathan to buffet St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which was ſome diſtemper, and provocation to ſin; now this made him grone and ſigh to the Lord, yea, it brought him on his knees thrice. As it is with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if his uſe bee to come ſuddenly upon a Towne, a wiſe Captaine will gather his forces together to hinder his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14441:87"/>
deſignes: So muſt the Saints, becauſe their corruptions ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them ſuddenly. Theſe make them cry out, This will be my bane; the leaſt ſin will damne me as well as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; <hi>I ſhall periſh one day by the hand of Saul, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 27.1.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a carnall man maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe, but beares all with a Piſh, it is not ſuch a great matter as ſome make it: I confeſſe I am paſſionate and cholerick; but I would I had no worſe to anſwer for, and the like. Oh, how doth this argue a graceleſſe heart, that can thus digeſt graceleſſe courſes. A toad will feede upon poiſon; but if a man take two or three drops, it will kill him: it is a ſigne thou haſt a toadiſh nature, that canſt digeſt theſe luſts. <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:14441:88"/>
15. <hi>ult. Eſau</hi> went away care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, when hee ſaw that hee loſt his birthright. I confeſſe, it is poſſible for a carnall heart to grieve for theſe diſtempers, but it is either when a man hath monſtrouſly befooled himſelfe, or when conſcience flies in his face; What, you go to heaven? Therefore a man on theſe termes may crouch, not becauſe of ſin, but of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or the ſting of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that lies in his boſome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Saints, when they are thus, it is but a pang, they come to their cold temper againe, and they then will welcomly entertain the word, and deſire that it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their ſinne. A gracious heart cares not what the man bee that diſcovers his ſinne, whether he bee friend or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14441:88"/>
whether a good man or a bad man. Hee lookes not at the man, but at the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the command. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Eli,</hi> when he had been indulgent, and the Lord threatned him for it, hee ſaith to <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Hide nothing from mee. Jonah</hi> being in a ſullen fit, forſakes Gods command; but this is but in a puſh; in cold blood hee is otherwiſe. <hi>David,</hi> that had the heart of a Lyon, he would not leave a man alive in <hi>Nabals</hi> houſe; yet <hi>Abigail,</hi> a woman, makes him ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed be thou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; thy counſell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> here was a gracious heart, that could ſubmit to the counſell of ſo mean a perſon. But a wicked man cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to have his corruption croſſed: they are ſo incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into it, that they cannot
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14441:89"/>
live without it: This was it that made the young man go away ſorrowfull. They mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt their inſtructers, as the Hebrew ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 2.14. <hi>What, wilt thou ſlay mee, as thou didst the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian yeſterday?</hi> Let every cup ſtand upon his owne bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome; what have you to doe with mee? &amp;c. A wicked man may bite the lip for the preſent, and ſay, I thanke you for your counſell; yet he will goe away, and fit you an evill turne. But the godly come, and acknowledge plainely, Theſe paſſages and grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will ſubmit to the truth with all their heart. A wicked man will uſe all means to undermine the truth, and miſconſtrue it; and if any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14441:89"/>
man will joyn ſide with him, hee will fly out deſperately: but if hee cannot avoid it, hee will (like the dogge) bite the ſtone; if hee cannot have his will of the man, hee will owe him a grudge. The Saints will ſay, <hi>The Word of the Lord is good,</hi> ſtrike here at this ſin,<note place="margin">Eſa. 39.8</note> ſmite home.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Saints are not only carefull to have their ſinnes outwardly mortified, but their lives reformed; they do not complain of this and that, and yet maintaine it: no, hee that is burthened with ſinne, will part with it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.8. When Chriſt came, <hi>crooked things were made ſtraight:</hi> not onely mountaines were brought low, but <hi>rough things</hi> were made <hi>ſmooth:</hi> So in the Saints of God, there is not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14441:90"/>
onely a new tongue, to talke of religion; but a new heart, and new affections. It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a godly man by the power of tentation to bee led aſide, yet you ſhall alwayes finde him on the mending hand, and ſo in concluſion forſakes ſin. I do not ſay, he will bee now and then drunk, and the like; (for we doe not read of thoſe, that after they accuſtome themſelves to groſs ſins, do ordinarily riſe again;) but I ſpeake of ſome boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſtemper which breaks out, yet I ſay, hee will bee of the mending hand. As a man in an Ague, when nature growes ſtrong, his Ague will leave him: ſo if a man bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with theſe, if grace grow ſtrong, hee will leave them, elſe hee erres from the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14441:90"/>
nature of true repentance. You know what God calls for, when hee requires repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ceaſe to doe evill, learne to doe well. Jer.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forſake his way, and the imaginations of his heart.</hi> This is repentance; this the Saints have done, as holy <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, chap. 34.32. <hi>If I have done iniquity, I will doe ſo no more. Pſalm.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I have kept my ſelfe from mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>They that are in Chriſt, have crucified the fleſh with the luſts thereof:</hi> the fleſh is ſin, the luſts thereof are the violent diſtempers thereof; hee that hates ſinne, kils theſe. Can any man kill the roote, and the bloſſome flouriſh? ſo, can the root of ſinne bee killed, and the fruit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14441:91"/>
thrive? It cannot be. Again, morality can make a man ſomewhat qualified, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grace much more? ſhall a Heathen bridle himſelfe, and not a gracious man? That cannot be. But a wicked man gives way to, and continues in his courſe without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and that's the reaſon why they fall to day, and fall to morrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. He takes faſt hold of iniquity, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into it, <hi>as the horſe ruſheth into the battell:</hi> for a man cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarily, uſually to bee tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with theſe boyſterous diſtempers, this is the ſpot of the wicked; no righteous man can alwaies bee thus: for hee hath not that depth of wickedneſſe in him; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome occaſion hee may
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14441:91"/>
and doth fall into ſin. You ſee how the godly are, and how the wicked behave themſelves. The wife railes, and the husband, out of a kind of ſottiſh <hi>Nabalneſſe,</hi> if any thing fall croſſe, makes the wife and child pay for it. This is ordinary, theſe are the plague-ſores of our townes; alſo the ſervant, if hee be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, then hee flies out, and warning muſt bee given preſently to be gone. Theſe are the ſpots of profeſſion now-adaies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. It is a word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,<note place="margin">Grace, ordering the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, brings the moſt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et life.</note> That a gracious heart brings moſt quiet to a mans life: that takes away the greateſt troubles: that is moſt peaceable. Nothing can trouble a gracious heart, unleſſe hee trouble himſelfe.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14441:92"/>
It is not the blowing of the winde that ſhakes the earth; but the wind is got into ſome hollow of the earth, and the ſhaking comes from within: ſo, when there is envie &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice within, theſe breed hatred without, and theſe ſhake our holds: whereas, were theſe removed, were a man quiet at home, hee ſhould never be troubled from without. It is not a mans condition, but his corruption that breeds diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>content; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I can abound, and be poor;</hi> hee had quiet within him. Looke, as it was with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. when the winds aroſe, hee commands them to ceaſe; ſo it is in the Lords power to rule theſe diſtempers: nothing under heaven can quiet a man thus
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14441:92"/>
enraged, but grace. Goe to God to take away thy unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Grace makes a man on Gods ſide, and therefore there can bee no diſſention: if God takes away any thing, the good ſoule is content; if hee will have any thing, the ſoule yeelds it, and ſo here is no trouble.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The framableneſſe of the body to act the ſervice that wiſedome and holineſſe required. The parts were not ſtiffe, not ſtubborne, nor
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14441:94"/>
weary, but in a readineſſe to act what wiſedome required. But wee finde it otherwiſe in us: St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that hee was clogged with it. When a man is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, either ſicke, or weak, there is a wearineſſe in holy duties. The body is then like a darke ſhop, in which a good workman may cut his fingers. When the body is full of noyſome humours, it is but an ill ſhoppe for the ſoule to work in: but this was not in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a fitneſſe in each part for its taske. The eye was fit to ſee, the tongue to talke, &amp;c. So that it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Galen,</hi> though hee were an heathen, yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the frame of the body, he fell in admiration of it; ſo
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14441:94"/>
that hee profeſſed, that it was not poſſible for a naturall cauſe to bring forth ſuch an effect. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Yeeld not your members inſtruments to unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> He calls the members inſtruments. The Devill oftentimes tunes the tongue, and hee ſeeth out of an adulterous eie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice vents it ſelfe in an unruly tongue. Looke againe in the 19. verſe, and there it's ſaid, a mans members ſhould be <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to holineſſe,</hi> tooles or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments that ſhould bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of God. In a tool, there is both the metall, and the making, as in a ſaw or axe; ſo there is in the parts of the body, which are tooles ſerviceable to wiſedome, and the power of holineſſe, that they may work their works
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14441:95"/>
thereby. An hand is a toole, whereby the mercifull heart may deale mercifully. Wee ſay, in ſuch a caſe, Here is a gracious tongue, a chaſt eye, &amp;c. ſo the hand is the Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a mercifull heart: ſo that this image of God in the body, is wide from that of the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What's the reaſon of this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This: Becauſe it was not only requiſite, that God ſhould inſtampe his image inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that is ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt outwardly, that others might ſee it, and glorifie God in heaven <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine among men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Shew forth the vertue of him that hath called you out of darkneſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:14441:95"/>
Hereby is Gods honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. <hi>We are the workmanſhip of God, created unto good works.</hi> When men ſee anothers excellent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, they ſay, This man was a skilfull workman: So Gods workmanſhip is ſeen in you, when another reviles, and you are patient to beare. When hee is impatient and utters words of reproach, the wicked ſtand by, and ſay, I marvell how you can ſuffer it: This is rare workmanſhip to them. When the wicked challenge godly men, and ſay, What do they more then other men? The anſwer is, They feare an oath, their ſoule abhorres the leaſt ſinne; goe thou, and do ſo: they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare a reproofe, doe thou likewiſe. But when a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14441:96"/>
wretched man comes to lye on his death-bed, ready to go out of the world, aske him then what hee thinkes of the Saints; oh, ſayes hee, that I might dye their death. Thus wee ſee, it is requiſite the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God ſhould bee in their bodies.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. This Uſe is for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hence wee obſerve the hainouſneſſe of the ſin of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces the image of God after a vile manner. What greater evill can there bee? He that clips the Kings coyne is a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; but if a man maimes the body of a Prince, every man thinkes no puniſhment is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him. That creature, for the creation of which, there was a conſultation; that creature, upon whom the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14441:96"/>
of God was imprinted, on whom all the works of the Trinity were expreſſed, of the Father in Creation, of the Sonne in Redemption, of the Spirit in Sanctification, which was the maſter-piece of Gods workmanſhip, to blemiſh that image, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the workmanſhip of God therein, what ſinne more hainous! It is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a crying ſinne, as it was ſaid to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.10. <hi>The bloud of thy brother cries up to heaven:</hi> Murther calls for vengeance, and will have no nay, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Hee that ſheds bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed:</hi> becauſe God made him after his image, therefore God purſueth the malefactor with unconceiveable horrour of heart. The reaſon is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14441:97"/>
becauſe of the unnaturalnes of it, (though that bee great, for, Lions and Lions, Tygers and Tygers will lie together;) but herein alſo appeares the vileneſſe, in that all the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God are up in armes againſt a murtherer, becauſe they have all been wronged. Drunkenneſſe wrongs ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, adultery wrongs chaſtity; theſe ſinnes wrong particular graces only, and a drunkard may honor God by ſobriety, as hee hath diſhonoured him by drunkenneſſe; but murther defaces the image of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bee recovered. There was a gracious tongue, but when it is murthered, it will never ſpeake more; a wiſe head,<note place="margin">Grace in the heart appears in the body.</note> but now will never plot buſineſſe more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. Hence wee ſee the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14441:97"/>
ſpreading nature of grace. Whereſoever holineſſe and righteouſneſſe is, it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelfe. If it bee in the ſoule, it will appeare alſo in the body. It is with grace, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of the Sunne, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. whereſoever it comes, it caſts in its beams: ſo it is with the ſun of grace, it goes into every crevice of the heart, and every practice of the life: there ſhall bee no work of the hand, no walk of the foot, but grace will frame it. Men thinke grace is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a corner; ſweare they doe groſly, but they have a good heart to God-ward: no, if thy heart be good, thy life will be good; if holineſſe bee there, the inſtruments will be in tune. Others conceive, grace meddles not with mens
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14441:98"/>
practice. No? Grace will meddle with every occaſion. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3.16. the Prophet ſpeaks of proud women, who walk <hi>with ſtretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go;</hi> even ſuch things grace will reforme. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 131.1. <hi>My heart is not haughty, my looks are not lofty. Rom.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Salute one another with an holy kiſſe:</hi> even our very ſalutations muſt bee holy; hence grace is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to leaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.33. When the oyle was poured upon <hi>Aarons</hi> head,<note place="margin">Pſal. 134.</note> it ranne downe to the skirts of his garment: ſo it is with grace, it deſcends to a mans apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſpeaking. Grace frames and faſhions every thing. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>His ſmell ſhall be as the ſmell of Lebanon.</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:14441:98"/>
Lebanon caſt forth an odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous ſmell, like a boxe of balme; ſo that as a wretched man leaves a ſtench behinde him, ſo an holy man leaves a ſweet ſmell of grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 3. We ſee hence how to get a converſation well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.<note place="margin">To order thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation well, get Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage into thy heart.</note> Get the image of God inwardly, and it will expreſſe it ſelfe outwardly. As the ſprings of a watch are, ſo the wheeles goe: ſo if there bee a principle of holineſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thy whole courſe wil ſtrike proportionably. The husband complaines the wife is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious; wilt thou have this reformed? it is not chiding will do it; bring thy wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanes, and get holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into her heart, and then the outſide will bee amended:

               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:14441:99"/>Two things are in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſoveraigne diſpoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature, I meane, the beaſts of the field, the birds of the aire, and the fiſhes of the ſea. Theſe were <hi>Adams</hi> journey-men. He could have called for the horſe to wait on him, &amp;c. ſo the text ſaith, Chap. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. For <hi>Adam</hi> was not to have dominion over the Sunne, or the Heavens, or the Waters, but over the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I call this a ſupreme, or ſoveraigne diſpoſe, becauſe it was allowed him by God, for next him, hee was above all creatures. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had preferred <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he ſaith, I onely will bee above thee. So God only would be above <hi>Adam,</hi> but all creatures ſhould
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14441:100"/>
bee at his diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein doth this dominion diſcover it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">And in what.</note>1. <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſupreme right and title unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: hee might in way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity challenge ſervice from it. Uſurped authority is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, but when a man hath a right title, this is true ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. Though God gave this to <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it was equall he ſhould reſigne it, if he required it of him. <hi>Adam</hi> was like a Steward in a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans family, unleſſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter giveth him authority, hee can have none; ſo it was with <hi>Adam:</hi> but ſince the fall, wee can challenge nothing. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7. <hi>To thee belongeth mercy, but to us ſhame.</hi> All that wee can challenge, is our owne

ſins, and our owne ſorrow. If therefore God would arme creatures againſt us, he may. What God will doe for his mercy, is one thing; what we can challenge, is another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> had ſkill and cunning to order the creature, and ſo could diſpoſe it that way, whereby God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive moſt honour. He had a ſufficiency in him to rule; for when God ſets a man of government in a place, hee furniſheth him ability. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. When God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his heart; and when hee took his Kingdome away, his ſpirit went from him. A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall muſt not onely diſpoſe himſelfe, but the Army: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> had cunning given him to diſpoſe the creatures.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:14441:101"/>3. Hee had authority and power to awe the creatures, and uncontrollably to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them in what he would. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. <hi>The dread of you ſhall fall upon all creatures:</hi> But wee are rebels againſt God, therefore the creatures goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: the wilde beaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes one, the horſe kils another: The creatures durſt not doe ſo to <hi>Adam,</hi> but if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> commanded any thing, the creature would performe it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Adams</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the creatures, implyed his ruling over them; They knew their names, and would come at his call. Thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that God named, <hi>Adam</hi> had no dominion over. <hi>Adam</hi> could not command the Sun to ſtand ſtill; but the living creatures would neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14441:101"/>
his command, nor ſtand ſtill and not doe it, when hee commanded.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing in the deſcription, is, that this was to further the ſervice of God, not to abuſe it. The creature was to ſerve man, as far as he ſerved God. As it is with a Vice-roy, the King makes him as himſelfe; but he muſt doe no more then his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was to rule over the creatures; but God gave him a Commiſſion, he might doe no more then whereby he might honour him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whence comes it, that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?</p>

All creatures have a deſire to come as neare God as they can; hence all creatures are unceſſant in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as the ſea runs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, &amp;c.

though hee were of never ſo high a place, yet if hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit treaſon, he loſeth his life, and his goods are confiſcated: ſo wee, having been traitors, have loſt, not only our lives, but our dominion over the creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Wherein doth this loſſe of right appear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No man ſince the fall can challenge, as his due, the uſe of the leaſt creature; ſo that if a man receive puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gods hand, hee hath no more then hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. God may take away a mans life, then much more every thing that ſhores it up. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.22. The lamenting Church naming of their ſins, quarrell not becauſe they have not this, nor that; but
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14441:104"/>
mark how they ſpeak, <hi>It is of Gods mercy that wee are not conſumed.</hi> God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſlay <hi>Iſaac;</hi> if God ſhould make every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the executioner of his owne child, hee required but what hee might. Whatever thou haſt beſides hell, is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; if we had dropped out of our mothers wombe into hell, and there been roaring, while now we are ſeeking to God, it had been juſt; for unto us belongeth nothing but ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man now defiled with ſin, hath not skill and ability to improve the benefit of the creature to the right end of it; and this is a great loſſe. The divine right of <hi>Adam</hi> was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mainely in this, He could improve the creature to the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14441:104"/>
beſt advantage. God doth not beſtow any good upon a man, that hee may abuſe it in the ſervice of Sathan; hee vouchſafeth not any bleſſing to this purpoſe: yet if God give us wealth, wee are ready to ſay to the wedge of gold, Thou art my God. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>To the impure all things are defiled.</hi> Each man, though the bleſſing be never ſo great, yet if hee be ſinfull, hee abuſes it. <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.13. If he which is uncleane touch any thing, it is uncleane. Such is the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our wicked hearts, that whatſoever bleſſing wee enjoy, it is uncleane unto us. A filthy ſtomack will turne the beſt meats into noyſome humours: ſo a ſinfull heart turnes the beſt bleſſings of God into the diſhonour of his
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14441:105"/>
name. What is better then the goodneſſe of God? yet a carnall heart will <hi>deſpiſe</hi> that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It goes againſt the creature, nay, it is a grief to the creature to ſerve a wicked man. It is a griefe, as I may ſo ſay, to the bed to lodg an adulterer; it is a grief to the drink to feede the drunkard, that feeds his luſts. This ſervice to them is not a duty the creature oweth, but a vanity it undergoeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>The creature is ſubject unto vanity.</hi> That is ſaid to bee vaine that attaines not his end; a mans labour is vaine, when hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not what hee laboured for: ſo the creature was made for good; but when it is per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verted, this is the vanity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: therefore the text ſaith, it doth this <hi>unwillingly.</hi>

that the bit cannot curbe it: the horſe ſlayes one, the oxe another; I ſay, when you find this that your ſubjects rebell, do not rail at them, but blame thine owne ſinne, and reaſon thus; I confeſſe, the creature may doe ſo; for how many commands have I had from God, and none would rule me, wherefore it is a wonder the creature takes not away my life? <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam ſmote the aſſe, and God opened her mouth, and ſhe ſaid, Was I wont to do ſo?</hi> as if ſhe ſhould ſay, It was not my fault, thou ſaweſt not Gods wrath.

                  <hi>An.</hi> It is a compact between God and <hi>Adam;</hi> in which, upon condition of yeelding obedience to God for him and his, God promiſed life to him and his.</p>
               <p>In the deſcription are two things, which are the parties of the covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The parties that make it; a covenant implies a covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, not with a mans ſelfe, but with another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The termes of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14441:108"/>
both are here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The parties; God and <hi>Adam:</hi> the Creator and the creature enter into an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement one with another; the one to obey, the other to bleſſe and aſſiſt. This the Scripture ſhewes us in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall of the covenant, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 19.5. <hi>If you obey my voice</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>you ſhall bee my peculiar people:</hi> and in the 8. verſe the people anſwer, <hi>Whatever the Lord hath ſaid, wee will doe.</hi> This diſcovers unto us the covenant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> though it were made many yeeres before. This Law oppoſeth the covenant of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. But <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2. they took ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oath, that what righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lawes God appointed,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14441:109"/>
they would performe, and God enters into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience for himſelfe and his poſterity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God promiſeth life to him and his poſterity upon theſe termes.</p>
               <p>He was to obey; for God delights in obedience. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. <hi>To obey is better then ſacrifice.</hi> God gives not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> a charge to bee rich, but to keep his commandements, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. God lookes not for men of great place, but thoſe that yeeld ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. As the maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends ſuch an office to the ſervant, and ſaith, This is your charge; ſo the charge that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14441:109"/>
God gave <hi>Adam,</hi> was not to gaine proſperity, but to obey. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep all his commandements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> After what manner was <hi>Adam</hi> to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The manner of his obedience appeared in foure things.<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hee had a power and principle in himſelfe, to keep Gods commandements. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had an uncontrollable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of will, whereby hee could begin his owne worke. He needed only an ordinary concourſe of Providence, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God gives to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God put this ſtock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adams</hi> hand, that he might manage the great affaires of life. But it is otherwiſe in the ſecond covenant; wee muſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14441:110"/>
ſee our ſelves loſt in regard of our owne ability to ſervice, and therefore wee are bound by faith to go out to another; which <hi>Adam</hi> needed not. We that are weake of our ſelves, muſt fetch power from Chriſt. It may truly be ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſomething of his owne. It was a debt to <hi>Adam,</hi> that if God required obedience, he ſhould beſtow ability on him; God could require no more of <hi>Adam</hi> in equitie, then hee gave him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to diſcharge: but it is mercy, that wee have any thing: So that the ſubſtance is this; <hi>Adam</hi> needed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, wee muſt deny our ſelves. Wee are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>it is not I,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, but Chriſt in mee. Joh.</hi> 1.16.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14441:110"/>
                  <hi>Wee receive grace for grace</hi> from Chriſt; nay, wee muſt waite on God, and ſtay his time; for hee may as well withdraw helpe as beſtow it; but he could not doe ſo with <hi>Adam:</hi> He engaged himſelfe never to bee wanting to him; but God oweth us nothing in point of grace. Hence the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of doing and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving are put in oppoſition. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of faith:</hi> the meaning is, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Chriſt is not the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the morall Law. He that beleeveth, ſaith, I can doe nothing; <hi>Adam</hi> might ſay, I can doe all things. I ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in Chriſt is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a worke of the Law, but of a worke of the Goſpel. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>By grace yee are ſaved through
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14441:111"/>
faith, not of your ſelves.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one had been ſaved by his owne works, as <hi>Adam</hi> might have been, hee had been ſaved by himſelfe; but now it is through Chriſt, and it is through grace that Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts us: this is the cauſe that many periſh who think to bee ſaved by the merit of their works; but this is croſſe to beleeving, this is not going out, but continuing within themſelves. <hi>Thoſe that are under the Law;</hi> that is, thoſe that ſeek for life by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, theſe are under the rigour and condemning power of the Law: <hi>Thoſe that are of Faith,</hi> that is, thoſe that are content to bee ruled by the power of the Goſpel, they are ſaved by Chriſt. This is the meaning of that parable,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14441:111"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. For <hi>Agar,</hi> ſpoken of there, is a type of the Law, <hi>Sarah</hi> of the Goſpel; the Law hath children, and the Goſpel children: the children of the Law are the children of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; but thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by grace, are free men, free from the guilt and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin. If a man will come to ſalvation by the Goſpel, hee muſt not come by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> had ſufficiencie in himſelfe fully to keep the Law in the rigour of it; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> heart, and the Law were of an equall breadth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. The Law took up his whole heart, and he was able to performe the whole Law. The Law was written in his heart, as in a book full writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, never a white line left.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14441:112"/>
                  <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.2, 6. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaith, hee will keep the <hi>whole Law;</hi> ſometimes hee will keepe it <hi>with his whole heart.</hi> It is not ſo with us: as of our ſelves wee are not able to think a good thought. Our faith is like a graine of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, mingled with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>We know in part, and we beleeve in part;</hi> our graces are mingled with many frailties. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>When I would doe good, evill is preſent with me. Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Sinne eaſily beſets the ſoule.</hi> When wee performe duties, corruption ſtands by, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it. In the beſt duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions may juſtly be taken; they anſwer not fully the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Adam</hi> might have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged a recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14441:112"/>
by way of juſtice, for his doing. He needed to crave no pardon, had hee obeyed the Law, as he was able; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there would be no fault in his performance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. If a man can performe the Law, recompence is due to him <hi>as a debt;</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> was able to doe. Hee might glory in the performance of his duty, giving alſo glory to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Boaſting is not excluded by the law of works, but by the law of faith.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, Could a man doe what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, hee might boaſt; but the law of faith excludeth boaſting: if I can do nothing but what God helps mee in, and perfect nothing but what God perfects in mee, why ſhould I boaſt? A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14441:113"/>
bee ſaved by workes and grace too. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If by workes, it is not mercy; if by grace, it is not his owne</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: when wee have done what wee can, wee can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing, but beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites, O Lord, who could ſtand! Adam</hi> could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured it; for he (I ſay) had no flaw in his obedience, but we (poore creatures) cannot doe this. Doſt thou think to bee ſaved by thy ſervices and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?<note place="margin">Rom. 4.7, 8.</note> No, <hi>Happy is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered:</hi> thoſe workes cannot ſave a man,<note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Adam</hi> did it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his poſterity; if hee

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14441:119"/>
from the joyning of the body and ſoule together, according to the kind thereof. The life of a tree is to grow; of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature to diſcourſe.

Had <hi>Adam</hi> looked towards Gods wiſedome, hee ſhould have been quickned in wiſedome: and ſo he might have received ſtrength from any Attribute, if he would ſubmit his heart to the ſtreame of it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. From Chriſt we receive <hi>grace
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14441:120"/>
for grace.</hi> What letters are in the ſeale, the ſame are in the waxe; ſo when by faith wee look upon Chriſt, there is grace in him, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to us. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 86.11. <hi>Unite my ſoule to thee:</hi> firſt the ſoule muſt be united, and then it acts from that union. <hi>John</hi> 6.68. <hi>Thou onely haſt the words of eternall life:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, By thy vertue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee muſt bee ſtrengthened.

                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:14441:120"/>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It lies in this; That God would ſo continue good to <hi>Adam,</hi> that if hee would obey God, hee would ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him with his grace, that hee ſhould have pleaſed him for ever: as if God had ſaid, If thou will doe what I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I will unchangeably ſupply life to thee.

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14441:121"/>
expreſſe it by the contrary: Thus it befell <hi>Adam;</hi> hee broke the law, and therefore was vnder the power of ſinne, to bee led by the force of it to ſinne eternally, and periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly. The Lord ſaid, Thou ſhalt not eate; <hi>Adam</hi> did eate; ſo going againſt the command, the Lord puts him under the authority of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this is ſpirituall death. So then, it is not the law of God that rules thee, but the vanity of thy minde, that domineers over thy ſoul, and members of thy body. Contrariwiſe, had <hi>Adam</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, he ſhould have been under the power of holineſſe, and never have ſinned. For God thus ſaid to <hi>Adam,</hi> If thou will keep my Lawes, I will ſupport thee, and thou

ſhalt never bee ſubject to any evill. As it is with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they can doe nothing but ſinne, and depart from God daily: ſo contrariwiſe, had <hi>Adam</hi> performed Gods laws, God, with a full ſtreame of immutable aſſiſtance, had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him on daily in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. This is the happineſſe of a Saint in heaven, not only to be freed from miſery and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, or to have joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light (a man was not made only for theſe) but to pleaſe God.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14441:124"/>
more, hee could not be ſaved by it. It is impoſſible for a man to keep the law ſince the fall, and therefore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the law to ſave him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon.</hi> The law begets children to bondage; it ſhewes a man his bondage in ſinne, and condemnes him for it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. To perſwade <hi>Adam</hi> of his faithfulneſſe; that hee would put it out of queſtion, that hee purpoſed ſeriouſly to doe what hee promiſed. Not that God needed this for any weakneſſe on his part, but to condeſcend to the infirmity of <hi>Adam.</hi> When a man hath ſealed to a covenant, hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fly off: therefore the Lord did it to make all ſure, and to fence them againſt the policy of Sathan, who told the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhee ſhould not dye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5.

It is a weake opinion of ſome, that thinke the tree would make <hi>Adam</hi> immortall, though it were after his fall. They prove it out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. elſe why ſhould God thruſt him out of Paradiſe leſt he ſhould eate of the tree of life?

               <list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by knowledge.</item>
                  <item>2. What by good and evill.</item>
                  <item>3. Why it is called ſo.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For the firſt: Knowledge in Scripture hath a double ſenſe. Sometimes it ſignifies, to bee able to pierce into the nature of things; as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. This ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was not here meant, for it was not here ratified, but taken away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſignifieth ſenſe and experience. We uſe to ſay, I never knew what poverty meant. Such a man may talk of it, but never had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the pinching of it: ſo wee ſay alſo, I now know what a priſon meanes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14441:128"/>
hee knew what it was before, but that was but a bare notion; now he hath taſted of it by experience, and can read the nature of it by proofe. So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> it is ſaid, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>knew no ſinne:</hi> hee had knowledge humane, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and therefore knew the loathſomneſſe of it: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is, he knew not what it was by his own experience. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.4. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhall know, that I am God; that is, hee ſhall know by experience, that I am a juſt God, and feele it to his coſt. So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.10. <hi>The wicked will not learne righteouſneſſe;</hi> and in this ſenſe it is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to wit, for experimentall knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Qu.</hi> What is meant by good and evill?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:14441:129"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Good implies two things. 1. A performance of duty to God, and pleaſing him. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>Hee hath ſhewed thee what is good.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I love the thing that is good in thine eyes.</hi> 2. It implies the happineſſe and bleſſing that flowes from clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with God. As a man by chewing meate receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ſo doth a man by doing good. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 125.4. <hi>Doe good to thoſe that are good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Evill is a diſobedience, and vengeance commeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by a juſt recompence of reward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Qu.</hi> Why is it called the tree of knowledge of good and evill?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not becauſe in it ſelfe it had any vertue to cauſe the knowledge of good and evill;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14441:129"/>
for in its owne nature it was as other trees: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. God ſaw that all things were good,</hi> and this among the reſt: But becauſe God did hedge in this tree, and forbid <hi>Adam</hi> to eate of it, it was therefore unlawfull, becauſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it.</p>
               <p>It was called thus in two regards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It did ſignifie to <hi>Adam,</hi> that if hee did eat hee ſhould die; and ſo have experience of good and evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Adam</hi> did eat, then through his owne ſinne it was made a means to make <hi>Adam</hi> know, by experimental proof, what it was to pleaſe God, and what to diſpleaſe him; as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. They ſaw by the eye of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience their luſts oveſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14441:130"/>
them, and ſhame follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and that they were deprived of happineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But why did God give theſe two contrary ſeales?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That <hi>Adam</hi> might ſee and know his changeable eſtate, that hee might goe in the right way, and be bleſſed; that hee might not goe in the wrong way and bee curſed. Our Sacraments are to one thing; by Baptiſme God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines us into his family, by the Lords Supper hee nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth us in his family.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That hee might make ful proviſion for <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo hee ſhould not ſay, If I had had this, I might have ſtood. For, like as it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. <hi>I have ſet life and death before you,</hi> God ſet the tree of life to encourage <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:14441:130"/>
and the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to affright him. Thus the Lord would bee wanting to him in nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hear cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin, aſwell as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> The Uſe that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the diverſity of the ſeales, is this: Hence we learn as well to heare curſes to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us from ſinnes, as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to encourage us. If <hi>Adam</hi> had need of this in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, that had no ſinne, how much more need have wee, when the flood gates of ſinne are within, abundance of bad examples without! If a man in a good and healthfull conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution need opening diet, then much more, a body that is corrupt, hath need of ſtrong phyſick. If <hi>Adam,</hi> that was in an wholeſome condition, had need of a threatning, how much more need have wee,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14441:131"/>
that have hearts overcharged with ſtrong diſtempers, and clogged with venome and malice. This cheks the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of carnall perſons, that think Miniſters ought not to ſpeak ſuch terrible things; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt bee wiſer then God, or wee muſt bee better then <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore wee ſhould deale with our hearts as men do with the creature; though it be ſomewhat tame, it muſt have an ordinary fence; and if it be unruly, wee ſhackle it: So <hi>Adam</hi> had a well tempered diſpoſition, yet he had a prohibition: but alas, our natures are like an unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med heifer, as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. that <hi>ſnuffe up the wind like the wild aſſe,</hi> &amp; are carried on violently into corruptions. What ſhall we ſay of theſe <hi>wild aſſe colts,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:14441:131"/>
as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks? Ch. 11.15. for if <hi>Adam</hi> had need of a chek, a thouſand threatnings are too little for ſuch wretches as we are.</p>

               <p>THis verſe ſhewes unto us the proof of a wiſe man, and one that doth truly take notice of all the occaſions of time, whereby he will <hi>redeem the time.</hi> Wiſe men will doe ſo.</p>
               <p>In the verſe are two things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Dutie; and 2. the Reaſon of it.</p>

               <p>To redeeme is to purchaſe, or to buy. The <hi>time,</hi> that is, a ſeaſon, not a diſtance of many houres, but a ſeaſon; and that is the convenience or meeting of many helps toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As winde and tide makes a ſeaſon to ſaile in: ſo when there is a faire day, and the ſun ſhines, tha'ts a ſeaſon of travelling. When there is no winde nor tide, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo many houres, but it is not a ſeaſon: ſo in the night, there are ſo many houres, but not a ſeaſon; no ſun-ſhine or light, and therefore not a fit time or ſeaſon for travelling:
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14441:132"/>

               <p>The Doctrine hence is this.</p>

               <p>For the further explication of this Doctrine, there are 3. queſtions to bee propounded.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What are the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of grace, what.</note>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are either generall, or ſpeciall. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall are ſuch as men take in the time of their life; here is the time of working, here is the time of doing and getting: for, <hi>In the grave there is no wiſedome, nor counſell, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. and there is no hope neither; for as death leaves us, ſo ſhall judgement finde us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note>2. There are ſpeciall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for every buſineſs: a time to plow, and ſow, and reap: ſo there is a day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a day of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:14441:133"/>Theſe ſeaſons may bee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we have matter to worke upon. Then is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when God calls us to do good. Sometimes the Lord caſts us among the poore, that wee ſhould relieve them; the ignorant, that wee ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them; the wicked, that wee ſhould reprove them. Sometimes the Lord lets us bee wronged, that is a time to uſe patience; and ſuffers us to be diſgraced, that is a time to uſe humility, and to trample all reproaches under feet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes there are ſpeciall meanes of doing our ſelves good; as upon the Lords day, which is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket day for our ſoules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſets out his wares to ſell, if men have hearts to
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14441:134"/>
come and buy; and ſuch are the Sacraments, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one with another. See how men do in worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo do you in ſpirituall: one man ſels cloth, another man corne: ſo ſhould Chriſtians: Thou ſhouldſt give thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a word of humiliation, he ſhould give thee a word of comfort, as thou ſtandeſt in need of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Lord enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the hearts of his children, as hee doth many times, that is another opportunity; take hold of it: when the Lord ſtrikes, ſtrike thou; when the Lord moves, move thou. As when thou heareſt the Word, and art convicted by it, and thy heart begins to move; oh then, that's a ſeaſon. Make hay while the ſun ſhines: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14441:134"/>
the blow, and breake thy heart, and humble thy ſoule; for that is a ſpeciall and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual opportunity for good to thine own ſoul. Or ſometimes, when thou art in thine owne private chamber, and the door ſhut, and the candle out, and the curtaines drawne about thee, then call thou to minde thy ſinnes, and the many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations thou haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; oh then humble thy ſoul, and break thine heart, and bleſſe the Lord for that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What muſt wee give for theſe opportunities of grace and ſalvation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">With what wee muſt part for them.</note> What will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow? This is Gods market day; if you will bid like a chapman, you are like to have them. I will tell you what
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14441:135"/>
you muſt give, and I will ſet downe the price in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man muſt part with all his ſinnes and corruptions; and a man may doe that upon as reaſonable termes as may be: for a mans ſins will never doe him good but hurt, and therefore he ought to forſake them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. (If it pleaſe God to ſet his commodities at ſo high a rate, then) wee muſt forſake all the comforts of this life, rather then loſe ſalvation. Not only pleaſures, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and delights; but meate, drinke, and apparrell, if God will have his wares ſo deare. Wee muſt part with all kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, friends, and all, yea, life it ſelf, if occaſion ſhould ſerve. But ſometimes the Lord is ſo
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14441:135"/>
mercifull, and the market goes at ſo low a rate, that a man may have both the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, and the means of grace and ſalvation too: but if the Lord require theſe, then we muſt let all go. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>I count all things droſſe and dung,</hi> yea,<note place="margin">

I count all <hi>dogs-meat,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I count all theſe things nothing: <hi>A Phariſee of the Phariſees, a Jew, circumciſed the eighth day,</hi> yet I account all theſe but dung. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27. There when Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Diſciples unto him, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Maſter, we have left all, and have followed thee: What therefore ſhall bee to us?</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:14441:136"/>
Hee anſwered, <hi>Yee that have followed mee in the regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Sonne of man ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his glory, even yee ſhall ſit upon the twelve thrones,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that you that are content to part with all, houſe and land, ſilver and gold, friends and acquaintance, and follow Chriſt, in the regeneration, all things ſhall be reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. Chriſt ſaith unto the young man, <hi>Follow me: I pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuffer me to bury my Father:</hi> No, no (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Let the dead bury their dead; but follow thou mee.</hi> So, when our hearts hang after commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and profit, and wee are loath to part with them, which indeed are but dead commodities &amp; dead profits: they ſay, they will heare and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14441:136"/>
attend afterward: oh (I ſay) <hi>Let the dead burie their dead,</hi> attend thou here.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wee ſhould beſtow the beſt of our labour, and our continuall endeavour about theſe things. Wee muſt not think that the Lord brings us up for nothing but to live as we liſt, and to ſpend our time about what we pleaſe; no, he will make us ſeek for mercy, and downe on our knees, and beg for it, and make us be glad that wee can have it too, and bee wonderfully thankfull for it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>One thing I doe, but leave all the reſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that which is behind, and preſsing forward to that which is before, to the reward of the high calling in Jeſus Chriſt, if by any means I might attaine unto it.</hi>

                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Is this the price? Yes: But then ſome may object, and aske, May a man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe purchaſe ſalvation?</p>

No merchant can get a commodity, unleſſe hee layes downe ſomething for it: ſo it is here; unleſſe we part with ſin, and pleaſure, and the like, we cannot have theſe. And theſe are the rates that God hath ſet on his wares; &amp; that's the reaſon why they are called purchaſing.

               <p>

               <p n="1">1. We muſt runne betimes to the market, wee muſt take the day before us, wee muſt ſeek after the means of grace and ſalvation, and ſeek it in the firſt place. Wee muſt know that there is no buying, but in the market, and all men that need, repaire thither, and wee muſt riſe betimes in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and be at the opening of the market.

It is ſaid there, that the people <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke all, and went up to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to ſacrifice to God.</hi> Many times a man goes four, or five, or ſixe miles to a market: I confeſſe, a man might make a ſhift for a while without a market, by borrowing of his neighbours; but a man cannot live without a market long, no, not the beſt gentleman in the countrey: ſo a gracious heart cannot live without the Word. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. The text ſaith, <hi>Whereſoever the dead carcaſſe is, thither the Eagles will reſort:</hi> ſo it is with the Saints of God; if there bee any Eagle-minded, they will reſort thither where Chriſt is taught, and there ſeeke for Chriſt, as the Eagles for the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:14441:139"/>
carcaſſe. If he be a dung-hill ſparrow, then he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live among the flyes: ſuch men can live whether there bee any market or no; whether there bee faſting or praying, or no, they care not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. The people there ſay, <hi>Come, let us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Jacob, that hee may teach us of his waies.</hi> Each man calls his neighbour; Come, let us goe to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or to the faire: ſo ſhould the Saints of God; Come, let us goe unto the houſe of the Lord, unto mount Zion, &amp;c. There are a generation that are content to have commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities cryed at their doores, &amp; will not come out for them to buy them: oh, ſurely ſuch men never knew the want of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:14441:139"/>As they muſt come to the market, ſo they muſt come <hi>with the firſt. Pro.</hi> 8.34. We muſt <hi>waite at the gate of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> we ſhould bee with the formoſt in the towne, not ſtay, as many doe, till halfe Gods ſervice is paſt. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103.4. <hi>My ſoule</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) doth even waite untill the morning watch:</hi> ſo wee ſhould wait all opportunities to be firſt in the Church, and tarry till the laſt. When <hi>Peter</hi> was to come to <hi>Cornelius</hi> his houſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.24. before hee came, they were all there. A good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a wiſe merchant will goe betimes to the market, goe, and ſtand at the townes end, and ſee what good cattle comes in, and what good pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worths may be bought; ſo that by this means he hath all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14441:140"/>
the beſt before him, and ſeeing all the good penny-worths, will let none goe out of his hand. Oh that yee were as wiſe for your ſoules, as you are for your bodies, to come betimes! He that comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, hath the chiefe, all the holy petitions, ſweet promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel, and uſes of inſtruction, admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and comfort: But for a man to come late, when the prayers are finiſhed, and the Miniſter hath tooke out his Text, and hath delivered ſuch points, and ſuch Doctrines, he loſes all the benefit of them; and why? he came after they were delivered: as when the dayes of Faſting were, wee came at the laſt duty, when as many ſweet prayers and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly petitions had been put
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14441:140"/>
up to the Lord; and what is the reaſon you got no benefit by them? oh, you loſt your market: you muſt ſeek to the means with the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When you are come to the market, you muſt <hi>attend upon it.</hi> You muſt beſtow your ſelves upon the meanes that God hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: you muſt come for ſome good end. A wiſe man, as hee comes to the market betimes, ſo when hee comes there, hee attends it: hee will not ſtand hanging about ſtalls, or ſlip into an ale-houſe, (yea rather, an hell-houſe;) but he will attend his buſineſſe, and ſee how the market goes, and obſerve the penny-worths; hee will ſee the choice things in the market, and will not let a good penny-worth paſſe his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:14441:141"/>

You muſt attend the market; for your go upon life and death, upon ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or damnation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not loſe your market. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Bee watchfull:</hi> let not a good penny-worth goe out of your hand, but <hi>hold it faſt.</hi> A wiſe merchant ſees a commodity, and layes hold on it, and will not let it goe; hee will cheapen it, and will not let it goe out of his hands for feare he ſhould loſe it: ſo, when the Word meets with you, hold it faſt; oh, that's my ſin (ſay,) and that belongs to me. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.13 The text ſaith, <hi>Lay hold on inſtruction, let her not goe, keep her, for ſhee is thy life.</hi> Deale with it as men do
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14441:141"/>
many times with a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if they ſet on it, they will have it whatever it coſt them. Oh that men were thus ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt! that they would reſolve, hee ſhould bee theirs, whatſoever he coſt them! oh that our hearts were thus ſet upon the means! When the Lord hath ſhewed thee the neceſſity of them, and God hath revealed himſelfe, oh, I ſay, hold faſt there, let not that opportunity goe: it will be a marvellous folly if thou doſt, and it will deprive thine heart of much benefit; nay, thou maiſt loſe thy ſoule by ſuch dallying; when you have time and opportunity, and yet loſe it, ſure it is for want of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. Likewiſe, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God muſt pray pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, beſides this, for they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:14441:142"/>
have private ſins as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins. Attend not, looke not after temptations, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the means. Many men, when they come to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, wil fall about their home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions; that which they ſhould doe at home, they doe in the market: juſt ſo it is here; when the Miniſter is preaching, then they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or praying, or conferring; oh this is a ſinfull thing; you muſt doe your owne buſineſſe at home, and not neglect the opportunity before you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Wee muſt lay aſide, yea, lay by thoſe that are the beſt commodities, and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> Wee ſee Tradeſ-men need many things; but thoſe things that are moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary, they will be ſure to have; and if their
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14441:142"/>
purſe will reach and hold out, they will buy other things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. Hee will buy bread now on the one ſide, and cloth on the other ſide: bread hee muſt have for his family to feed them, and cloth hee muſt have to cloath them; and if his money will hold out, then haply hee will buy ſome lace, or a rattle for his child: So I ſay, you have the choyce of all favours, and of all mercies; now provide that which is moſt neceſſary; <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe thereof, Mat.</hi> 6.33. This is the maine thing: it is of neceſſity that the ſoule ſhould be ſaved. What is here meant by the <hi>Kingdome of God?</hi> Some ſay, It is the kingdome of glory; others, the kingdome of grace: but
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14441:143"/>
how can a man ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory, but firſt hee muſt have the kingdome of grace before that of glory? And how ſhall a man attaine to this? The Lord hath vouchſafed it to none, but to thoſe that do ſeek it in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; it is to bee had by the preaching of the Goſpel of grace. Was there ever any man ordinarily converted, but by the Word of God?<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> for <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> &amp;c. This Word is the word of the Kingdome; firſt ſeeke that by which faith is bred, by which Chriſts righteouſneſſe is made ours; make this ſure to thy ſoule: for this is that you cannot be without; this is that which <hi>David</hi> deſired, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27.4. <hi>This is that I will require, Lord,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that I may
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14441:143"/>
dwell in the houſe of the Lord, and ſee thy face in the beauty of holineſſe.</hi> You make little of the preaching of the Goſpel, and never regard it; but <hi>David</hi> was glad of it: O Lord (ſaith hee) <hi>One thing I have deſired,</hi> whether I have health or no, life or no, I care not, but one thing (Lord) I crave, <hi>that I may ſee thy face in the beauty,</hi> &amp;c. For this did Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Mary;</hi> Martha,<note place="margin">Lu. 10.42.</note> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, <hi>thou art cumbred about many things, and much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but</hi> Mary <hi>hath choſen the better part; that ſhall never be taken from her.</hi> Whether is the ſoule better then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? A child of God will ſay, The ſoule is beſt. Whether is prayer better then profit, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven better then earth? if pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and heaven bee the better,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14441:144"/>
then let the earth ſtay, let commodity ſtay, let profit ſtay, let heaven and ſalvation be ſerved firſt. This daſhes the dreames of many men, that will not ſtir out of their ſhops. though they may well bee ſpared; will rather loſe the Word of God, then loſe the profit of ſix pence. Oh ſee now, come, and lay theſe things together, and ſee the difference between them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But deferre not the time: Now, what will you give for them? Me thinks I heare mens ſoules ſay, O mercy, mercy is worth a thouſand worlds. Oh, what availes it to be rich and miſerable? ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14441:144"/>
and accurſed? You little ones, what ſay you? Do not you wiſh for mercy? O mercy, mercy; without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we are for ever wretched; oh, it is mercy that wee live, and are not ſent quick to hell. But now, will you buy it? you ſhall have it cheape enough. What will you give? (Now wee come to the maine) You muſt give as the market goes, and on Gods termes, for you muſt not thinke that God will ſave you with wiſhing: Oh, no, no, he will not. But now, Will you buy them? Then bid faire: you muſt part with all your ſinnes; away with the proud heart, and away with the world and the pleaſures thereof. Now ſee how the world replyes. Firſt young ones reply, We have no wit,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14441:145"/>
nor underſtanding; well, you muſt beleeve, elſe you muſt periſh. The old man ſayes, I am weake and feeble; well, you muſt get faith, or elſe you muſt periſh too. Now you know the price of it, you muſt provide to pay it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44. There it is ſaid, <hi>The wiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, when he found the pearl, went and ſold all that he had to buy it:</hi> That was a great price. Thou muſt ſell all to buy this: if thy luſt bee as deare to thee as thine eye, thou muſt part with it; if thou haſt a proud heart, thou muſt downe with it; if a man have a faire eſtate, and ſo many hundreds, and ſuch lands, and ſuch and ſuch wares in his ſhop, if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, hee muſt part with it all. The drunkard muſt part with his cups, and the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14441:145"/>
with his queans: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe yee doe part with theſe, ye cannot have Chriſt; this is the price of it. Returne to me an anſwer whether you will have it, or no, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne an anſwer to the Lord, that hee may preſerve it for you. See that of <hi>Judas, Acts</hi> 12.24. He would rather have the 30 pence; yea, he would betray his Lord for it, and he had it: but hee came againe with horrour of conſcience, and threw it away, and threw away himſelfe too; for hee went and hang'd himſelfe, and now hangs in hell for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. It is an eaſie matter for a man to tell over his money, but not ſo eaſie to make the heart willing to part with it: but if you will not part with it now, there will come a time
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14441:146"/>
at the day of death, and then the covetous man will ſay, Here, take my money that I have got by oppreſſion; and the drunkard will ſay, Here, take my cups. Then (I ſay) now part with them; be wiſe merchants, part with them now, and the match is made: Then now reſolve. Is it mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (ſaith the ſoule)? then it is enough, Lord take all, though I never ſee a good day more: if it be mercy, then Lord take all; my God I will have, my God I muſt have: ſo that now the decree is ſet downe, what ever it coſt I will have it, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.23. and now I ſee the commodity is faire, and the offer is kind. As a merchant, if he have a great ſtock, ſome in corne, ſome in houſhold-ſtuffe, and land, and cattell, if
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:14441:146"/>
he ſees a bargaine, he will ſell all that hee hath; yea, leave himſelfe neither ſhoppe nor houſe, and all to buy this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: ſo I beſeech you, play the wiſe men; here 's a deale of time ſpent in eating and drinking, and ſleeping, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating, and apparrelling, and company-keeping, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and vaine things: Play now the wiſe men, now God muſt have time, prayer muſt have time, and now a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne heart will aske a great deale of time to batter down; many a ſigh, and many a tear, and many a prayer; now no more apparrell then will ſerve the turne, &amp;c. What a deale of tricking and trimming there is for the body! It might fare well with the ſoule, if it were but ſerved as our ſinkes are
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14441:147"/>
many times: what waſhing and ſcouring have they? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this tricking and trimming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you doe not leave it, it will coſt the ſetting on, if God require more then this. Be wiſe for your ſoules; if you have not time enough, then put off your pleaſure, nay, and put off the world too, nay, put off friends, put off all, ſell all. No marvell indeed, though many men ſay, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell how ſuch a man lives, and runs up and downe ſo much: oh, let them know, there is a purchaſe in hand that will well requite both his paines and coſt. Doe not then ſtand hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, and break off for a little odd money. For many ſay, I would ſerve God, but my friends will forſake me; and I would come to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14441:147"/>
Gods houſe on the week day, but the boyes in the ſtreete would laugh at me. I ſay, why will you dodge with God in this manner? Wil your friends ſave you? When you lie on your death-beds, and your conſciences accuſe you, and you cry out, Now friends ſave mee: they cannot; for they may periſh, and you too. Oh, away with this dallying with God. What if your Landlord frowne on you? what if your father forſake you? Reſolve thus. What though I have the frowne of men? I have the favour of God. What though the world be gone? yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is my comfort; happineſs, that's not gone: Then ſay, I'll dodge no longer with God. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtuck faſt to his corruptions, yet <hi>To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14441:148"/>
Lord, and to morrow</hi> hee would leave them, and yet he prayed againſt them, and at laſt hee read the place in the <hi>Romans, Lay aſide chambering and wantonneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and then he ſaid, <hi>Why not to day Lord?</hi> and ſo ſtrooke through the bargaine. You ſee the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, if you will have it, ſpeake: if you have it not, you may go away, and repent you of it as long as you live. Now I pray you anſwer me; Will you have grace? will you have ſalvation? and will you buy this, and give as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket goes? tell mee, doe not delay while to morrow. Why not to day? O let your ſoules anſwer and ſay, Yea, Lord, to day. Take all, onely ſave my ſoule. Come what will come, I'll have it. Then now the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:14441:148"/>
buſineſſe is ended, the bargain is made; go and take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; it is yours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Buy not onely for time preſent, but for future times.</hi> If thou heareſt the Word of God now, then ſtore for thy ſoule. Let this day bee a day of reconciliation; and then you may ſay, at ſuch a day the Lord afforded you grace, and you bargained, and that the Lord knowes it: Keepe that by you, that when Sathan tempteth you, and ſaith unto you, Have you any grace? you may recall this, and ſay, I provided ſuch a day againſt ſuch a queſtion, and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the time, place, and ſtone I ſtood on, and the Miniſter that ſpake, and the Lord is my witneſſe. Oh ſtore up: it is the part of a wiſe man ſo to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14441:149"/>
doe. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.23. <hi>Who attends, that hee may heare for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Joh.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I ſpeake unto you, that in the time to come yee may remember them.</hi> So yee ſee the opportunities of grace, the market day for it; then go home cheared, and, having gotten grace, keepe it by you. Hee that was content to ſell all, hee had the pearle. This will cheare you, to ſell all to get Chriſt, and keepe him by you.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place: When the match is made; then in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things you doe, you muſt change the property of them: you muſt now trade for grace, uſe the world as if you uſed it not, and you muſt not live to your ſelves, but to God; you muſt trade for God, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14441:149"/>
walke with God. You ſee how you muſt beſtow your labour and paines, elſe heaven will not bee had. If you aske the maner how you muſt ſeek theſe things; it muſt be in the firſt place: Come to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket betimes, and ſee the choyce, and buy the beſt upon any termes, and ſtore up for the time to come; and then buy other things. You muſt ſeeek grace in the firſt place: when you are at the meanes, you muſt beſtow your heart on the means; and when you have ſeene the bargaines, lay aſide thoſe that are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and then part with all to have them; and thus ſtore up for the future.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, Uſe all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means no otherwiſe then to help you forward to ſpeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:14441:150"/>To proceed; Now wee muſt retaine in our callings three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wee muſt uſe them ſo, that they muſt give way to ſpirituall things. I would not have tradeſ-men ſo ſet to their callings, as that they will give no liberty for prayer, and for hearing of the Word of God. Let commodity, let profit go to the wall, rather then to let prayer and the Word to fall, and to be neglected. <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdome of God:</hi> As any man will doe, if there come two men to him, if the one be better then the other, he will bid the other ſtand by till his betters be ſerved: ſo it is here, God is better then commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then profit; then let God be ſerved firſt, let dutie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:14441:150"/>2. We muſt ſo uſe our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as that we may bee the better fitted to perform more duty to God. It is very fit wee ſhould have ſome taſt of God in our daily imployments, that we may thereby be the better fitted for his ſervice. As a man takes a cup of ſack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupper, not that he makes a meale of it, but to make way for his meale: juſt ſo, we ſhould have our hearts more enlarged by it to performe our duties, every way to take notice of Gods favour and kindneſſe towards us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt keep heavenly minds in earthly or worldly occaſions; and that is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous hard thing, &amp; this is the reaſon that the Saints of God being ſnatcht away by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly occaſions, and ſo
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14441:151"/>
many buſineſſes, that their hearts many times come to be deaded and dulled. But a man ſhould uſe them no further, but that his heart may bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to God. Looke what good wee finde in our trade, let us bee led by that to ſee what goodneſſe is in God, who is the fountaine of all good. When we ſee that great good, and the commoditie that comes in to us, then let us ſee the riches of God: and ſeeing this is ſo good, what ſhould wee think of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God? Let us ſee his goodneſſe in it; for unleſſe the Lord ſmile on us, what avails it for us to bee rich? what, to be rich and to be damned? this is very pitifull.</p>
               <p>But what is the reaſon men are ſo backward in buying
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14441:151"/>
theſe things? how ſhall wee doe to bring men to bid like chapmen? The reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them may bee taken from two grounds.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The excellency of the commodity.</item>
                  <item>2. The time wee have to purchaſe it.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. To make the firſt plaine,<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to be bought.</note> theſe three arguments are to be taken from the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the meanes of grace and ſalvation is a thing of as great excellencie and price as can bee; therefore in reaſon wee ſhould lay downe a price for them. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commodity is, all wiſe men will lay down anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The price of ſalvation is a great price; becauſe there is nothing better that is or can
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14441:152"/>
be deſired. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wiſdome is a precious thing, but above all things get underſtanding.</hi> The world, honours, pleaſures may be got; but Wiſedome is beſt of all, therefore get that firſt. For all the things here below are vaine things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are lying vanities; but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. and <hi>that will make us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever</hi> too, if wee are humbled by it. The Word of the Lord will ſtand by us, for it is an immortall Word, and it will make us immortall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: it will ſtand ſo by us, as it will make us live for ever, and it will cheare our ſoules when nothing in the world will. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Wee muſt <hi>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> Now the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14441:152"/>
how wee ſhall doe this, is not by making our ſelves rich in this world, and getting the things thereof, but by getting grace, that it may goe well with us: this is the maine thing that wee may get the love of God, to get our ſoules to be humbled and caſt down. Now, if this bee the beſt, (as it is) then in all reaſon, it requires the greateſt price. Is it ſo, that the Word of God will endure for ever, will ſtand by you and ſave you? then if you give a price for any thing, give moſt for that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the meanes of grace is beſt, and of greateſt worth; ſo it is moſt neceſſary for us. What is the reaſon that men buy commodities? Becauſe they have need of them; as if a man ſhould ſay, This I muſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:14441:153"/>
have, and I have need of it. Gold is better then ſilver, and pearls then both; but bread is beſt of all, for all theſe muſt be left for it: a poor man will part with ſilver and gold, and all for bread, for that he muſt have. Now, there is nothing ſo neceſſary as for the ſoule to be ſaved; for if a man want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, hee may make a ſhift; if he be poor, haply his friends be rich, and they will relieve him well; but if the ſoule have ſinned, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſerable by reaſon of ſin, oh what hope, what help but only from God! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is moſt needfull: without it the ſoule is ſtarved &amp; famiſh'd: And what though you have mony? yet your ſoul may periſh, and goe downe to hell. What's that to the ſoul
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:14441:153"/>
for a man to bee rich, or what is that to the ſoule to have the perſon applauded, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all things, and the poore ſoule is ſtarved and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd, and wants all things? Me thinks I heare your ſoules cry out, The body, that's cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, the houſe filled, and the ſhop, that's ſtored; oh, ſayes the ſoule, I ſhall bee damned; all is provided for, only I ſhall ſmart for it, I ſhall pay for all, I ſhall goe to hell for it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you think of it. The time will come when you will prize mercy, and cry out for it. When thou lieſt on thy death bed, when thou art breathing out thy laſt breath, then one dram of mercy Lord, and then one dram of faith Lord; then it wil be worth a world to thee. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. It is ſaid there, the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:14441:154"/>
fooliſh Virgins cry out, Wee have no oyl, oh, lend us ſome; oh then, Lord, open unto us. One day the poor ſoule will have need of mercy. You ſee that it is moſt neceſſary, then buy it, leſt you bee forced to borrow and cannot have it. So then there is but one needfull thing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> It is not of neceſſity to be rich, it is not of neceſſity to be honourable; but oh, this is of neceſſity, that thy ſins ſhould bee pardoned, thy perſon accepted, and thy ſoule ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is a point of great chriſtian policy, for in getting of grace and ſalvation, you ſhall get all other commodity with it, and all other good things. It is the beſt husbandry to buy that which will bring in moſt good. For all outward
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14441:154"/>
comforts and contentments that this life can afford, they come all in this. As, a man that ſees ſuch a tree, and ſuch an acre of ground, if it likes him, he will not go to buy that, but he will buy the Lordſhip, and then all the trees are his, and all the ground is his. So, this is our miſery, we ſtand puddling our ſelves here for a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and for a little riches: go (I ſay) and buy the Lordſhip, and then all will be made ſure unto thee. <hi>Pro</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Get wiſdome, for life and honour are on her right hand, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and pleaſure are on her left hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Firſt ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, and all other things ſhall bee caſt in upon you.</hi> So that a good man compares all this outward commoditie to pack thred &amp; paper, which
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:14441:155"/>
if a man goes into a ſhop, and buyes wares, he ſhall have into the bargaine for nothing. So here, get once grace, and then all things elſe you ſhall have into the bargaine: for <hi>Godlineſſe is great gain: it hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. You may ſit and ſing Care away; for all is yours, heaven is yours, the earth is yours. It is a marvellous folly in men, who take a wrong courſe to thrive. If you would bee rich, then <hi>Conſider your owne wayes, and your hearts, and turne unto the Lord;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hag. 1.16.</note> for that is the way. It is not all the policie, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and caring in the world that will make a man rich; for the Lord hath a veine of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to waſte this mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and a ſecret plague to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14441:155"/>
plague another mans wealth: So now conſider your waies. Conſider, how that when you were careleſſe of God, then the Lord cruſh'd all you did. Where are mens hearts, thus to waite upon, and to follow God? I ſay, where are mens hearts? if grace bee the beſt good, then labour herein.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly,<note place="margin">Time to purchaſe it, is but ſhort.</note> See the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that God gives us to get grace. From whence we may draw two reaſons. One from the ſhortneſſe of our life: and the other from the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the meanes of grace and ſalvation, by reaſon of our unprofitableneſſe. It is our wiſedome to ſtrike while the iron is hot; the means of grace and ſalvation is ſhort, and hee that dies without grace ſhall never be ſaved. Conſider of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:14441:156"/>
it, this may bee the laſt time that I ever ſhall ſpeake, or you ſhall heare: for the Lord may take away our lives, or the meanes from us. Therefore while you have time, imploy your time; for there is a great deale paſt, and that's gone, and cannot bee recalled againe; ſo that's none of ours: then for the time to come, that's none of ours, for we cannot tel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall live or no; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely the time preſent is ours. Heare therefore while you have time and means: the offer of grace is tendered: <hi>Oh turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die!</hi> But ſee what became of it; the Lord offers commodity, but 'tis not worth the buying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome What ſaith the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Oh Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, how often would
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14441:156"/>
I have gathered you as an hen doth her chickens, but</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ye would not!</hi> O let us not ſtand out with God, leſt hee leave ſuch an heavie doome upon us, as hee did on <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now <hi>your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi> How often would I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you, and you would not! O then I ſay, take heed that the Lord doth not ſay to us, O <hi>England,</hi> how often would I, but you would not! Ye care not now for teaching, yee will have no inſtruction: Well, you ſhall not, (ſaith God to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>), you ſhall never ſee my face more till you can prize it; yea, till you ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that commeth in the Name of the Lord, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna in the higheſt.</hi> So the Lord may ſay unto us, Oh ye
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14441:157"/>
have refuſed mercy; but yee will cry and houle, and never ſhall have mercy more. How doſt thou know this, oh man, whether ever thou ſhalt have the offer of mercy againe? You may never have any more offer. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 41. Chriſt <hi>ſtood over Jeruſalem and wept, Oh</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that thou hadst known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace, but now they are hidden from thine eyes;</hi> now they are taken away becauſe ye would not. They may have the Word, but ſhall finde no good in it. Oh that is the doom of all dooms, when the Lord curſes his bleſſings, when the Lord gives a man up to the hardneſſe of his own heart, and to the blindneſſe of his owne eyes! Who knowes but the Lord may ſpeake to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:14441:157"/>
ſome of us now, and that hee will never offer nor worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.27. <hi>They ſhall call and cry, but I will not anſwer them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Who knowes, but that this may bee thy lot? This may bee thy ſhare. Is there any one whoſe ſoule ſtirres within him, and ſayes, Oh the precious means of ſalvation that I have had! how kindely did the Lord come, and I had almoſt yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and yet withſtood the Lord! Is there any that hath been thus? I charge thee take heed leſt the Lord ſet it down upon thy forehead, Wel, grace hath been offered, and it hath been refuſed, it ſhall never be offered more; My Sabbaths they have had, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned them; well, they ſhall never ſee Sabbath more: of all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14441:158"/>
plagues, there is none like to this. O fearfull, that the Word ſhould never work more; and <hi>They ſhall cry, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer! Pro.</hi> 1.24. A man were better to be torn in pieces with wild horſes, then to hear that voice: Wiſdome ſaith there, <hi>I will laugh at your deſtruction.</hi> When a man is in perplexity, and the Lord ſhould ſee him, and laugh at him in his miſery, and ſhould ſay, This is he that heard the Word and oppoſed it, this is the man; come and behold him, O Angels, come and rejoyce at his deſtruction; this is he, let him be accurſed; this is hee that deſpiſed all meanes, therefore ſend him downe quick into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: then ye will know what it is to oppoſe grace. Time may come, that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14441:158"/>
pray, and thou mayeſt have no heart; or if thou doſt, the time may come when God will not hear thee. Oh, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all means, and therefore with what heart can I doe any thing! Oh that ye would but think on this; thou mayſt ſeek, and ſeek, and ſeek often, and that with tears, and yet mayſt have the repulſe. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.41. The people of Iſrael began to murmure againſt the Lord, <hi>Would to God wee had dyed in Egypt.</hi> The Lord heard them, and made a ſolemne vow, that they ſhould never enter into the land of Canaan. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.45. <hi>Then they returned and wept, and prayed, but the Lord heard them not.</hi> Therefore take heed how yee oppoſe grace and ſalvation: I beſeech you, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14441:159"/>
his ſake think of it. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offers of grace have wee had, and then have ſaid, wee would labour that our hearts might bee enlarged towards God, and wee would be more holy? wee have had many Sabbaths, how little have wee profited by them? If God ſhut the Iſraelites out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan for the refuſing of one offer; feare God, I ſay, feare and ſtand agaſt. Seeing it is ſo, it is the part of wiſe men to take the offer of grace and ſalvation whileſt it is offered to them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Apoſtle hath preſſed the diſtreſſed &amp; ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Jewes to the practice of a marvellous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and holy duty, but a marvellous hard one, and that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14441:160"/>
indeede which might ſeeme moſt unſeaſonable, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extreme purſuers that then purſued them beyond ſtrength almoſt. The duty was this (as it is expreſſed in the words of the text) <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Brethren, count it all joy when you fall into many temptations.</hi> Each word carries a weight, and a kinde of impoſſibility to a diſtreſſed ſpirit, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed heart. Hee ſayes not, they ſhould finde this by proofe, and that it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in iſſue, that temptations would bring them forth plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruits of righteouſneſſe through the bleſſing of the Lord; but hee bids them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it ſo before hand, when they felt nothing but vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this was not to bee done alone when they were
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14441:160"/>
aſſaulted by troubles, but when they were oppreſſed with them too; not when they met with miſeries, but when they fell into them: now, when hee falls into a pit that he is over head and eares in it; he falls into the ſnare, ſo that hee is intangled in it; and yet then he muſt count it joy: and further, not when they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome temptations, out of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> there were ſome hope to get out with ſome ſpeed: but when they fall into many, and yet more, to make the matter wonderfull, he wils them not alone to count it <hi>ſome</hi> joy, but <hi>all</hi> joy. When their miſeries were ſo great that more could not be endured, yet there their joy muſt bee ſo great, that more could not be expreſſed. A duty wonderfull hard, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14441:161"/>
wonderfull heavenly! and therefore in verſe 4. he adds marvellous ſweet and pithie reaſons to perſwade to ſo heavenly a taske; and they be taken from the incomparable profit that would come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: a man ſhould be a gainer by all his loſſes, and a getter by all his extremities: The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their faith would bring forth patience, and let patience have her perfect worke, and then they ſhall be perfect, and intire, and want nothing. For they that have no want may have all joy, if any in the world may.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the feeble heart might here haply reply, How ſhall a poor ſinner, who wants both wiſedome and ſtrength, bee skilfull to know how to carry himſelfe in ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14441:161"/>
or yet bee able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe ſuch preſſures paſſing ſtrength? To this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle anſwers in the 5. verſe, <hi>If any man want wiſdome, let him aske it of God, who gives abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and upbraids no man, and it ſhall be given him.</hi> By wiſedome is meant, not the grace of ſpirituall underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the generall; but that ſpeciall point of wiſedome which might ſute with the preſent occaſion, and make a man cunning to carry the croſſe. And the Apoſtle ſo propounds the direction, that it might anſwer and point to all the carnall pleas that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and diſtreſſed heart might caſt in the way; and therefore you ſhall obſerve each cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is worth obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. If any of you bee bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14441:162"/>
and perſecuted, not only ſuch as are able Chriſtians, of great graces, and large abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of glorious parts and performances, and therefore might hope to ſpeed beſt; no, if any the weakeſt, the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and the meaneſt. Oh, but I want a world of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo much that it's not like to finde a ſufficient ſupply; a little will not ſerve the turn: Why, behold the Lord gives abundantly, richly; if thou beeſt a beggar in knowledge, he hath riches of knowledge, and he can ſupply thee. Oh, but I have abuſed his mercy and help in this kinde, which he hath given mee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I feare hee will give mee no more: He will not upbraid the ſinner for what hee did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe; (the text adds, <hi>hee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14441:162"/>
no man</hi>) but will give him what he needs and askes. Oh, but what's that to mee, that God hath enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on whom he will, if hee will give none to mee? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this alſo is anſwered; for the words ſay, <hi>If any man aske, it ſhall bee given him.</hi> Now this may ſeem ſtrange, and to be too good to be true to a diſtreſſed ſpirit, and a diſtruſtfull ſoule; Why, is it poſſible that God ſhould give wiſedome to mee, who am ſo ignorant? ſuccour and ſupply to mee, who am ſo weake and unbeleeving? I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it, I cannot think it, much leſſe can I expect it at the hands of God: therfore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the words rehearſed, gives us a caution to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer direction; <hi>Let him aske
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:14441:163"/>
in faith:</hi> What a man askes, it ſhall be given him; but take this with you, alwaies provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, hee aske in faith: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if a man doubt, he ſhall be diſappointed of his hopes. So that the ſcope of the words are to teach us how to pray, that wee may bee ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what wee pray for.</p>
               <p>In the words two things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The duty required, <hi>Pray in faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The hinderance to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded, which may let the duty; <hi>Nothing wavering:</hi> and this wavering is further ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a double argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A diſtreſſed, diſtruſtfull, ſtaggering heart needs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vexe &amp; trouble it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wil be racked and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14441:163"/>
in it ſelfe in reſtleſſe diſquiet: for ſuch a man is like unto the ſea waves, whirling now this way, toſſing againe that way. Feares and hopes are the hangmen of the heart; Hope ſayes, It may bee, and Feare ſayes, I ſuſpect it will not be; thus a man becomes like a wave.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This doubting doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre a man of that he ſhould have. Let not that man think to have any thing at the hands of God. Thus the Apoſtle cuts off the ſoule from any expectation of good. Let not that man; as though hee had ſaid, Let none ſuch plead any priviledge; for neither ſhall be accepted that unbeleever, nor that party, nor any that ſtaggers and wavers, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the performance of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14441:164"/>
Gods promiſe. Againe, hee ſaith not thus, He ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any great favour, but he ſhall receive nothing from the Lord. To put it paſt perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, hee adds peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Let not ſuch a man cozen himſelfe with vaine hopes and groundleſſe expectations, that yet the Lord will pity and ſupply him. Hee affirmes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely: Let him not think it; I would not have him ſo much as imagine ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it will never be.</p>
               <p>We purpoſe only to trade in the maine dutie, which will be our taske at this preſent: ſo that the Doctrine will be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Hee that purpoſes to prevaile in prayer, muſt bee ſure to aske in faith.</p>
               <p>For the ſenſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is here to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14441:164"/>
that it is preſumed in the text, that a man hath faith, and hee that is to pray is ſuppoſed to bee a beleever: for how can he pray in faith that hath no faith? But that is not all, nor ſufficient to expreſſe the ſenſe of the point, That he that prayes ſhould bee a beleever; but that hee ſhould put forth the power and vertue of his faith in prayer; Nay further, it is not alone here required, that hee ſhould put forth the work of faith in generall tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Covenant; as, that God is reconciled to him: but, that hee ſhould exerciſe the work of his faith touching that particular which he is to begge, and which hee now begs at the hands of God; and this eſpecially is to bee atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For theſe two works are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14441:165"/>
farre differing one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and may be one without another. Each faithfull man doth beleeve the covenant of grace touching the pardon of his ſinne, and the attainment of eternall life through Chriſt; and yet may ſtagger on the promiſe touching ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and hee ſtands in need of. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was ruled by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and caſt himſelfe upon the call, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and promiſe of the Lord, departing from his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fathers houſe, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Gods direction and bleſſing in the land unto which hee would bring him, and where hee had engaged himſelfe to bleſſe him; and yet he was not perſwaded of that ſpeciall branch of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:14441:165"/>
that he would give him a childe out of his loynes, which ſhould bee an heire to him, (as the text plainely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.3.) Now both theſe acts of faith are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the laſt is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended: ſo that the full ſenſe of the Doctrine ſeems to be this; He that will ſpeed in prayer, muſt put forth the vertue of faith, to beleeve in particular the obtaining of that he prayes for. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick.</hi> He ſaith not, The prayer of a faithfull man; but <hi>the prayer of faith:</hi> as though the Apoſtle had ſpoken thus, It's not the man ſo much that muſt pray, as faith in the man, that muſt frame and follow thoſe petitions which we put up, if ever wee ſpeed. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:14441:166"/>
11.33. <hi>Whatſoever yee aske praying, beleeve you ſhal receive it;</hi> that is, the very particular which you beg for, ſhall bee given you. For the clearing of the Point, we will enquire,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What it is to pray in faith.</item>
                  <item>2. The Reaſons why hee that doth begge in faith ſhall receive.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To pray in faith, according to the ſenſe of the Doctrine, implyes 3. things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith ſees, and ſettles upon the fulneſſe of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and the freeneſſe of the riches of grace in Chriſt, which is able every way to ſupply it, and to ſatisfie abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly all the neceſſities which can befall the ſoule: and this gives ground and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto faith, to go to God,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14441:166"/>
becauſe there is enough to be-had, and therefore it's likely it ſhall ſpeed of that it would have. Thus <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Hee beleeved that God who had promiſed, was able to give a childe, though his body were not able to beget one, being now dead: Sarahs</hi> wombe was not able to conceive one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now barren: therefore he counted it bootleſſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them; but being fully aſſured that God was able, was encouraged to go to him, to rely upon him by faith: This al ſufficiency gives foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or foote-hold to our faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the riches of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe encourageth faith for to pray, ſo in the ſecond place, it cloſeth with the ſpirit in the promiſes, ſets that on worke,

               </list>
               <p>For the firſt, Whether we have a title to the Sacrament, or no, we will diſcover it two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="345" facs="tcp:14441:175"/>1. Wee will ſhew what doth intereſt the ſoul thereto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What doth not hinder; and conſequently, what alſo doth hinder the ſoule from comming.</p>
               <p>Inverting the order: Firſt then, What doth not hinder? I anſwer briefely and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Firſt, the want of the ſenſe and feeling, either of Gods favour towards us, or of the preſent apprehenſion, to our owne ſenſe, of Gods grace in us, doth not hinder. I ſay, that the want of the ſenſe and feeling, either of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the ſoule, or of the worke of grace in the ſoule, doth not hinder a man.</p>
               <p>The ground of it is this; If hee that hath great intereſt in Gods love, may yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14441:176"/>
not be aſſured of it in his owne ſenſe; if he that hath a great work of grace, may yet not be able to apprehend that worke that God gives; nay, if a man that walkes exactly before God, cannot ſee the power of grace, that helps him ſo to do; it is certain, this cannot hinder him from the right of comming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; But the former may be, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Rule is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 2. This is no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from comming to the Sacrament, that a man findes a deadiſh heart within him in the performance of ſervice; that a man findes a body of death oppreſſing of him, and lying upon him when hee comes to this duty: And the reaſon is this; becauſe the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14441:176"/>
ſoule, (ſometimes) when it is moſt peſtered, and the heart moſt deaded and clogged, is then truly in the eſtate of grace, and alſo walkes moſt humbly before God, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to depend upon, and ſeek much more for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and to ſtrive moſt ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt its corruptions: all which argue, that a man is deepely intereſſed in Gods love, and hath an intereſt, in a great meaſure, to the Lord Chriſt and his Covenant, and ſo conſequently to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I dare ſay this, That the worſt ſervices of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man to his owne ſenſe and apprehenſion, finde moſt acceptance with God. The pooreſt duties, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance outwardly, are ſometimes moſt perfect;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:14441:177"/>
Why? Becauſe then the heart is moſt abaſed in it ſelfe, and then it ſees moſt neede of Chriſt, and then alſo doth it crave ſuccour and reliefe from Chriſt therein. In a word, as inlargements of heart, and great freedome, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and ſufficiencie many times unto duty, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed often with moſt falſeneſſe, at leaſt wiſe with moſt pride and haughtineſſe of heart; ſo deadneſſe, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, untowardneſſe, inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is many times accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with moſt humility, with moſt brokenneſſe, with moſt baſeneſſe, with moſt going out of himſelfe unto Chriſt, and with moſt ſincerity in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the heart unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 3. The third Rule is this: Former unpreparedneſſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14441:177"/>
unto Gods ſervice, and haply ſometimes (to a mans owne ſenſe) unprofitableneſſe under the Sacrament, in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereof, is not, ſhould not bee any ſufficient hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to any faithfull ſoule to come yet freely hereunto: for it skils not what a man hath beene formerly, nor what his failings have been in former times at the duty, if now thoſe be amended, and hee be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them, &amp; ſtrive againſt them, yea, and for the preſent doth addreſſe himſelfe unto this duty. There cannot but be many failings in each mans performances; what then? if this ſinne might hinder, then other ſins might hinder alſo: but no ſin may hinder a man from comming to Chriſt; for it is a great ſin not to beleeve
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14441:178"/>
in the Lord, yet a mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unbeliefe, as it muſt not keepe him from comming to Chriſt; no more may it hinder him from comming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the body &amp; bloud of Chriſt. Beſides, ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe before, hinder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſinne? that ſhould rather make us take heed that we doe not commit a ſinne in not comming to the Sacrament when we ſhould; for if unpreparedneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs hinders becauſe it is a ſin, then not comming when wee ſhould come, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders becauſe it argues a ſinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhall I know whether I have the worke of grace; and ſo conſequently title to, or intereſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?</p>

So that where there is true grace, there is power againſt all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and the ſoule that is truely wrought upon by Chriſt, is enabled by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord Jeſus to maſter any diſtemper.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, The text doth not ſay ſo: the text ſaith this; <hi>The evill one toucheth him not:</hi> that is, cloſeth not with him, faſteneth not upon him, doth not domineere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him: this is to keepe a man untouched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhall a man know that hee is only oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and foiled by corruption, and that yet he is not touched with it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on this manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the ſoule cannot maſter corruption as it would, and overcome the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly diſtempers thereof, yet it will ſtand in the defence of Jeſus Chriſt, and will not plead for a baſe corruption: he will not ſay, Oh, it is my infirmity, it is my nature, alas, I cannot
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14441:179"/>
amend it, &amp;c. but a gracious heart will come to this; hee ſees his ſinne, and obſerves his diſtemper and corruption; and the heart ſaith, The Law is holy and good, the reproofe is good, the admonition is good, the duty good; yea, the ſoule will freely ſay, I have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt heart under heaven; but the Law is a bleſſed Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the ſoule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and hates, and loathes, and diſcovers, and purſues all manner of traiterous devices and rebellious diſpoſitions in others againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is certaine hee did never hate ſinne in himſelfe, that joynes or ſides with ſinne in another mans heart and life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obſerve what authority, or what value, or what excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14441:180"/>
the Word hath in the account of the ſoule: namely, Is thy ſoul under the ſupreme government, and ſoveraigne royalty and authority of the truth? if it bee, then it is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoule. It is one thing for a man to have ſufficiencie to the diſcharge of a dutie with ſtrength and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and another thing to be under the authority of the truth, and to ſubmit himſelfe to the governement of that good Word. There is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that ſometimes hath been much in my thoughts, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.29. <hi>Take from me the way of lying, and grant me thy Law.</hi> Sin is a way of lying; not only a <hi>ſtep</hi> of lying, but a <hi>way</hi> of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the whole guiſe &amp; cariage of it is deceitful: now when he ſaith, <hi>take away the way of lying,</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:14441:180"/>
his meaning is, I cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it my ſelf, but good Lord take it away: And the text ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>grant me thy Law:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, It is the greateſt bleſſing the ſoul deſireth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in this life. For when the ſoul is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent that God ſhould pluck away every corruption from him, even the deareſt, it is a ſigne of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But the queſtion here growes further, namely, how a man ſhall underſtand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee be content that God ſhould take from him the way of lying, and to part with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beloved corruption?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſhall obſerve this in two or three paſſages.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Do thus; obſerve either what ſpeciall ſinne you have in your ſoule, and what the darling, and the ſecret diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14441:181"/>
of the heart is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if not that, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a man is in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: there be ſome particular corruptions that ſally out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man when hee comes to his particular place; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the ſin of a mans nature and conſtitution hath failed, yet the ſinne of his calling hath overthrown him, and alſo diſcovered him to be falſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And thirdly, obſerve what it is in the world, or in any outward contentment, a man puts the higheſt price and the greateſt eſteeme upon: as thus, One man he eſteemes wealth, &amp; is not able to endure poverty; and another man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemes his credit, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to ſuffer ſhame; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man the glory of his
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14441:181"/>
parts, that hee would have a ſufficiency above another, &amp;c. Now (I ſay) if yee will trie whether the ſoule be content that God ſhould take away the ſinfulneſſe of the heart, try it thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By finding out if the ſoule bee in good earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Lord ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all theſe courſes, and whatever ſinne is in them, and ſhould ſhame him for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Lord ſhould take away all theſe, and the Word take place, and pull away all theſe diſtempers, and then the ſoule findes a reſtleſneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord pluck them away from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether the ſoule is willing, and ſtrives much, and contends ſadly that it may be content that the Lord ſhould
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14441:182"/>
take all that outward excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency from him, that is ſo much prized by him: If hee prize wealth, to bee content that God ſhould make him a begger; if he prize his credit, content that God ſhould co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him with ſhame; if hee prize his parts and gifts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that God ſhould make him lye in the duſt. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſoul is not content to part withall (if it be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing) that is a way of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he loves it imoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Oh where is that man that can beare contempt, that can beare poverty, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be left under the table, and to bee made baſe in the eyes of the world! Hee that would hold any thing that he is not content the Word ſhould take away, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14441:182"/>
that that is the king, and the maſter, and the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the heart.</p>
               <p>Now the text adds, <hi>And grant mee thy Law.</hi> Whether the heart have this frame, is diſcovered in theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heart puts the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price upon the Word, and the graces of God therein working, and conveighed thereby: as namely thus, The ſoule that is addicted to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, cries, Grant mee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, Lord; the ſoule that is addicted to pride, prayes, Grant me humility: he puts a higher price upon that which is contrary to his ſinne, then ever his ſinne was ſweete to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee lookes for, and is willing alſo to entertaine the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14441:183"/>
authority of the Word to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and to carry him out to this way and worke.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly he finds a full ſufficiency and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe herein. <hi>Grant mee thy Law;</hi> I deſire no more: Now by this time a man is fully under the authority of the Word: though I cannot doe what I would, my corruptions being ſtrong, my temptations boyſterous, yet <hi>take from mee the way of lying:</hi> Whether it be my beloved ſinne, or ſinne of my calling, or the outward comforts of thoſe things I prize, I am content it ſhould be taken away. And when it ſaith, <hi>Grant me thy Law,</hi> 1. It moſt prizeth it. 2. It moſt yeelds unto it. 3. It is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein. By this time (I ſay) it appeares, a man hath
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14441:183"/>
a title unto the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Touching the fitting of our ſelves for the Sacrament, two things are a little to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 1. The neceſſity of our comming: The ſecond is the manner how to prepare our hearts when wee doe come, that we may come fitted, and (as we are neceſſarily injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) prepared to this Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, ſeverall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are to bee propounded and anſwered, and then the point will be cleered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Is it left unto a mans liberty to come, or not to come unto the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not a point of indifferency, it is a point of neceſſity, which the Lord lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us as a duty, which God expecteth from us, if
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:14441:184"/>
God affords occaſion with conveniency; it is a ſinne in us to doe the contrary: I ſay, If God afford occaſion with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, nothing ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming; yet ſome ſtraight may haply lie upon a man, that it were neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite nor reaſonable for him then to preſſe in to that duty. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were it ſo that a man could not receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unleſſe he ſhould croſſe ſome comfortable aſſurance of Gods favour towards him in the committing of ſome ſin; as to receive it by halfs, as the Papiſts do; then he were not bound, nay, hee ought not to receive it; it is not a point of conveniency; for no man muſt <hi>doe evill that good may come thereof:</hi> it is their fault
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14441:184"/>
who pollute the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in aberring from Chriſts inſtitution, it is not my fault not to receive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond caſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie is, when a man ſhall occaſionally preſſe into a place, and not bee acquainted with the Congregation; or give offence unto it, becauſe he belongs not unto that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: in this caſe the Lord affords him liberty to depart; the reaſon is, becauſe it is a wrong done, ſeeing hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come unto Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance without being trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto the people where he is, which God (who is the God of order) allowes not, nor requires.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Sacrament bee ſo ordered, and ſo given and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, as the occaſion of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14441:185"/>
the times carry, that haply it is done three or foure times in the weeke, by reaſon of the multitude of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as now on Eaſter day, Eaſter munday, and Eaſter tueſday, and the like) I take it, a man is not bound here at all times to come particularly to the Sacrament: and the reaſon is this; becauſe God requires that I ſhould come alwaies to a Congregation, when, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of the Church, it is appointed or celebrated for all; but here it is celebrated at ſeverall times for ſeverall perſons, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: And now theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions premiſed, it is a ſin for a man not to take all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in the place where hee lives, to partake of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:14441:185"/>
that hee hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his good.</p>
               <p>Now the grounds of the Point are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our own neceſſity might juſtly require this: our ſinnes many; wee want ſtrength and power againſt them: our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſmall; weakeneſſe of grace great, and therefore we had need of all the helps that may encourage us, of all the means that might ſtrengthen us, of all Gods ordinances that might carry us on with more chearfulneſſe, and comfort, and ſufficiency in a Chriſtian courſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look wee here to the mercy of God, and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods goodneſſe, and the bounty and the large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that God makes for us: hee alſo requires our care and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:14441:186"/>
chriſtian attendance unto the enjoyment of the meanes for our good; the Lord is the Maſter of the Feaſt, it is his mercy to provide theſe means, and his free grace to give us liberty to enjoy them: then, to turn our back unto theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, is to caſt his kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into the kennell; it is an high diſhonour to God, and an high contempt unto his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. But what if a man bee not prepared for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? is hee then bound to come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, he ought not to come unto the Supper of the Lord; but this hee muſt know, His ſin is deſperate, his offence is hainous and high, that he is thus unworthy, and ſinfull, and unprepared for to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:14441:186"/>
come; and therefore he muſt not reſt here in this eſtate, but take it as a marvellous hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and miſerable condition, wherein hee muſt never give himſelfe reſt untill he get out thereof. There is ſuch a pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhnes of diſtemper in a mans ſpirit, &amp; ſuch an idleneſs in his nature, that, becauſe he cannot have and do what he would; therefore he will neither have nor doe what he ſhould; and becauſe his heart is not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the like, therefore he will be content to continue in his corruptions, and keepe his ſinne; and caſt Gods kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe behind him; for, in effect, he ſaith, he will not doe what hee ſhould, unleſſe the Lord will doe for him what he liſt. A gaine, there is alſo an idle diſtemper in the heart, when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:14441:187"/>
a man thinks thus, If I ſhould come to the Sacrament, I muſt walke thus ſtrictly and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and I muſt part with my corruption; and that is the reaſon we will not receive the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. But you will ſay, What great ſinne is there in this, that a man ſhould abſtain from comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? wherein appeares it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appeares in this; in that the ſoule loveth his ſinne, and harboureth his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption more tenderly, and imbraceth it more neerly, and prizeth it more highly then he doth the bloud of Chriſt, or the mercy and favour of God in Chriſt: this every man (that will not prepare for the Sacrament, nor come to the Sacrament) ſhewes by his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:14441:187"/>
practice, and proclaims in the courſe of his life.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee handled was, After what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or how he ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p>There bee two things here conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How a man ſhould bee prepared for the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How he may partake of the benefit and fruit of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>For the former, that a man may bee prepared for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt have theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Faith, Repentance, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Love; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe no man can receive good from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But here may ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ſay, If a man cannot
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:14441:188"/>
find or feel that he hath grace, muſt he therefore abſtaine?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A mans ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the judgement that he paſſeth upon himſelfe out of his weakneſſe, is no rule to go by in this caſe. The reaſon is, becauſe many times the beſt Saints are moſt ſuſpicious, and hee that hath moſt grace in temptation, hath leaſt ſenſe and feeling of his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Why, how then? what courſe muſt hee take, and by what rule muſt he be judged?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> He muſt openly, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plainly, and to the full lay open his eſtate unto ſome faithfull, judicious, and holy-hearted Miniſter; and if upon ſincere relation of his eſtate, the Miniſter, out of the Word, ſhall anſwer all the objections that he can make againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14441:188"/>
and is able to give, out of his owne relation, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convince him, then is hee bound to ſubmit unto the Word, and to addreſſe himſelfe unto the partaking of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For preparation to the Sacrament, it is not enough for a man to have theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but he muſt renew them, and put freſh colours upon all thoſe ſpirituall abilities that God hath beſtowed upon him: hee muſt not only have faith, repentance, knowledge and love, but hee muſt renew all theſe. For the renewing of repentance, obſerve this: Look what ſin thy ſoule hath over-loved, look what ſtaines and blots thy heart hath taken ſince thou haſt received the Sacrament, and get thy heart
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14441:189"/>
more looſened from every ſin then ever it was before the committing of it, and never leave it untill it bee come to a right ſet and frame, and as ready to entertaine the grace that is in Chriſt, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereto, as formerly thou haſt been, nay, more then ever thou waſt before. Alſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thy faith thus: Looke what doubtings and ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thou haſt had ſince the laſt Sacrament, how thy faith hath been weakned and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and renew this grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh: and to this purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this rule; See a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſufficiencie in thy ſelfe then ever thou didſt formerly, and come with greater bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and confidently expect more mercy and favour from the Lord by his ordinances
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14441:189"/>
then ever thou didſt before. And ſo likewiſe for renewing of thy love, obſerve this rule: See a greater need of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament then formerly thou haſt done; and then ſee a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength &amp; aſſiſtance to be received from the Sacrament every day more and more.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſecond thing, which is the way to partake of the good of the Sacrament: that is done theſe waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt rightly inform your ſelves of what you muſt expect from, and what you may have in the Sacrament; what you come for, and what is there to be gotten: All ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good that your hearts can deſire is to be had here: The ſoul can want nothing, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing; God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed nothing, can beſtow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14441:190"/>
but it is here to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The ground is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is there, and all his merits; and he that hath the Sonne hath life, and in him, all things: In a word, all that the ſinner can deſire, as, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of what is amiſſe in him, power for the ſubduing of all corruptions for him, and the quickning of his heart to the well-pleaſing of God, are all conveighed and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſoule by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to bee received therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt underſtand how this is communicated to the ſoule in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How is pardon and power conveighed unto mee by the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer; This comes from a right diſcerning of the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:14441:190"/>
body and bloud of Chriſt: when I can ſee beyond the outward elements, and ſee the ſpirit of Chriſt undoubtedly communicating the ſpirituall good, as I ſee the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments communicating the temporall good; when I can ſee ſomething beyond bread, and ſomething beyond wine, and ſomething beyond brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſomething beyond pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out, ſomething beyond taking, and ſee as certainly the Spirit of God communicating the ſpirituall comfort unto my ſoule, as the outward elements would do to my body: in this caſe the Spirit of God doth as certainly communicate aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods favour, &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt corruption, and to walke with God, as the bread doth food to my ſtomack, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:14441:191"/>
the wine ſweetneſſe to my taſte and refreſhment to my nature: I ſay, the Spirit of the Lord doth as undoubtedly give Chriſt and his merits, the fruit and benefit of them in the forgiveneſſe of ſin, and ſtrength againſt corruption, as dryneſſe goes with the bread, and moyſture with the wine.</p>
